It was 34 years since the legendary England opening batsman had faced the Indian medium pace bowler while playing for Yorkshire. And it is the perfect tribute to Amar Singh that Hutton still remembered the hard time that the Indian, then a member of the 1936 Indian team, gave him. Another England great Wally Hammond described Amar Singh's bowling as \"he came off the pitch like the crack of doom\". Indeed, Amar Singh, along with Md Nissar was the first great Indian bowler for his accuracy, stamina and ability to make the ball move alarmingly off the air or cut it devastatingly off the pitch. He played in all the seven Tests before the war. In the first Test in 1932 he took four wickets and hit an attacking 51, coming in at No 9. Against England in 1933-34, he was the country's best bowler taking four for 106 off 54.5 overs in the second Test at Calcutta. In the final Test at Madras, in the absence of Nissar, he had to work overtime and rose to the occasion with a bag of seven for 86 off 44.4 overs in the first innings. Going in at No. 4, he scored a hard hitting 48.  Amar Singh was however at his best in England where the conditions suited him. In 1932, he took 111 wickets (20.78) and made 641 runs (22.89) in the first class matches. By 1936 he was a popular Lancashire League professional and was released only for a few games for the Indian touring team. In the first Test, he took 6 for 35 in the first innings. In the second Test he again displayed his batting prowess by hitting an unbeaten 48 to help India draw the game. In the final Test at the Oval he scored a valuable 44 going in at No. 4 thus proving beyond doubt that he could be classified as an allrounder. At home, he was at his best against Lord Tennyson's team in 1937-38 when he bagged 36 wickets (16.66) in the five unofficial Tests. In a short but brilliant Ranji Trophy career for Western India and Nawanagar he took 105 wickets at 15.56 apiece.   "], "known_as": "Amar Singh", "fullname": "Ladhabhai Nakum Amar Singh"}

He dismissed Adam Parore and Ken Rutherford, and consistent performances against South Africa at the end of the summer gained him a place on the 1994-95 Ashes tour. However, he didn't escape the injury jinx that hit the tour, a torn side muscle forcing him home early. After a wicketless Texaco series against the West Indies in 1995 he disappeared from the England scene, but remained a high quality county performer nonetheless. It seemed, however, that his chance of higher honours had gone, until in September 2005, he was named in a 17-man squad for England's tour of Pakistan. The arrival of Shane Warne at Hampshire had revived his career and turned him into a much more attacking bowler, and he continued to make valuable runs in the lower order. The one blot on Udal's career is the three-year ban from club cricket handed to him after being found guilty of violent conduct, while playing for his club, Camberley, in the Surrey Championships. He retired from first-class cricket at the fag end of the 2007 season and was offered the chance to play for Berkshire in 2008. But in December, aged 38, Middlesex lured him out of retirement to sign him on a two-year contract and his career to another surprising twist when he was named captain part-way through the season before being confirmed in the job full-time. He was unable to turn the club's fortunes around, however, as they finished second from the bottom of division two in 2009. After struggling early in the part of the 2010 season he resigned from the captaincy. At the end of the season, he also announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the age of 41.

Selected to tour West Indies with England A in 1990-91, illness prevented him taking part, and a loss of confidence kept him from further international honours until an A tour to Australia in 1996-97. Chosen at last in the full England squad to tour Australia two years later, Hegg expected to carry out the tour as understudy to the captain, Alec Stewart.  However, England's dismal performance in the Ashes series, and a growing perception that Stewart was being overburdened, prompted a re-think after the third Test. To free up the captain to open the batting, Hegg made his Test debut at Melbourne on Boxing Day. He held on to his place for the final Test at Sydney, but although he kept tidily he failed to make much impression with the bat.  After Stewart reverted to all three roles in the World Cup the following summer, Hegg was overlooked at the start of the series against New Zealand, when the selectors instead chose the young Nottinghamshire keeper Chris Read. By the end of the summer Stewart had reverted to the role of wicket-keeper batsman, which he held for another two years.  Stewart's unavailability for the 2001 tour of India prompted the selectors to consider Hegg again. After another admirable season with Lancashire in 2001 (in which he had averaged over 40 with the bat) he was included in the squad along with the young Essex wicketkeeper James Foster. However it was Foster who played throughout the two Test series in India and New Zealand. To Hegg's disappointment, the selectors reverted to Stewart when Foster had the misfortune to break an arm in the nets at the start of the domestic season.  Hegg holds a notable record of 11 catches in a first-class match, set in 1989. His batting, like his keeping, is consistent and has steadily improved. Hegg was appointed captain of Lancashire in 2002. After finishing third and second in Division One of the County Championship in his first two years in charge, Lancashire were hotly-tipped to be champions, but when they were relegated after a season of internal unrest, he resigned.

His bowling relies on a muscular shoulder action and plenty of reverse swing at a decidedly nippy pace which he struggled to maintain as injuries took their toll. When White first played for England, it seemed that Ray Illingworth's Yorkshire bias had overstepped the bounds of decency. But in 2000-01 on the subcontinent, England wondered how they got by without him, and in December 2001 he hit a stirring first Test hundred in the heat and dust of Ahmedabad. He finally batted well against the Aussies at Melbourne in 2002-03 ... and then revealed he'd ripped a rib muscle while bowling the day before. England waited until the last possible moment for him to prove his fitness for the 2003 World Cup, testament to his perceived pivotal allround role. But he again broke down, and injury limited him to nine domestic appearances as a specialist batsman. He was appointed captain of Yorkshire in 2004, but it proved a disappointing year for the club, with their worst showing for 12 years, and for White himself, with just seven appearances this time.

But in 2002 his career reached crisis point as his marriage crumbled in full view of the tabloids. With England's busiest-ever winter looming, he announced his retirement from the one-day game, took an indefinite break from all forms of cricket, returned and announced his readiness to tour Australia - and then pulled out again in a move which seemed to signal the end of his Test career.

Small took 5 for 48 and Australia were rolled over for 141. When England won, Small was named Man of the Match, as much for his enthusiasm as anything: he was always a whole-hearted tryer, a committed team man and a delightful guy.

He came to England from Barbados just after his 14th birthday, the cut-off date for automatic qualification. However, the combination of his looks and his then-pair of nerdish specs made the Lord's registration committee think he had no chance of ever playing Test cricket anyway, so they let him through. In good times, Small might not have played for England; he was neither especially fast nor reliable, and early in his career was an infuriatingly regular no-baller. But he cut his run right down and settled for being predominately an outswing bowler, still hostile enough to worry even the best batsmen, as Australia found again a week after the MCG, when he whipped through the middle order in Sydney.

He was dropped twice in unusual circumstances: by Sussex for \"not trying\", and by England for barging India's Sunil Gavaskar off his feet at Lord's in 1971. Gavaskar, the non-striker, had crossed Snow's running line in going for a quick single after the ball had been pushed towards mid-on. Two years earlier, in Pakistan, Snow had cost himself another cap by bowling fast bouncers at Tom Graveney, the vice-captain, on a dangerous net pitch in Lahore the day before a Test. The son of a Church of England clergyman, Snow was a strange mixture altogether. Away from cricket, until he mellowed, he could be unapproachable.

As opener he saw his first task as scoring heavily enough to protect his teams against defeat, and in Test cricket and the County Championship - the matches that counted in the first-class averages - he was as sparing with the attacking strokes as, in retirement, he is strident in his opinions on the game. How valuable he was to England is shown by the fact that only 20 of his 108 Tests ended in defeat, mainly when he failed. His most productive strokes, off the back foot through the covers (his speciality) and the on-drive, were majestic in their power and placement. But he was not the man to press home an advantage.

Although he lived in the shadow of his more famous brother for a number of seasons, progression to international cricket was inevitable. The only sour note when his promotion eventually came, for the fourth Test of the 1990-91 series against England, was that it arrived at Steve's expense. Critics took issue with Waugh's apparent loss of concentration at times and his capacity to occasionally succumb to lazy-looking shots. The weakness was on show most evidently during his disastrous 1992-93 tour to Sri Lanka when he scored four successive Test ducks, but it would be hard to find a player more difficult to contain when in full flight. To complement his batting skills, he offered handy part-time bowling as a medium-pacer-cum-offspinner and a remarkable penchant for spectacular saves and catches - he had few rivals to match his freakish brilliance in the field. His many highlights included a world-record partnership of 464 for the fifth wicket with Steve for New South Wales against Western Australia in 1990-91; his sterling 138 on Test debut; three commanding centuries as an opener at the 1996 World Cup tournament; and 126 to seal the Frank Worrell Trophy in West Indies in 1995.

Despite an unusual grip on the blade (one hand was placed close to the top of the handle and the other near to the bottom), Phillips was a natural strokemaker and one who was particularly confident when executing horizontal bat shots.  It was this confidence - as well as a willingness to sacrifice himself for the good of his team - which was integral in his emergence as a successful opener for the Croweaters in the early 1980s and in his elevation to Test level at the start of the 1983-84 international season.  Phillips enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top flight: his commanding 159 against Pakistan in Perth made him only the fourteenth Australian in Test history to compile a century on debut.  But it was not long before the same sense of selflessness that had inspired his transformation from a middle order player into an opening batsman acted as a millstone around his neck.  In mid-career, he was asked to become a wicketkeeper on the basis of his experience as a gloveman at underage and club level and as a response to the development of a gaping hole in the Australian team following Rod Marsh's departure.  While the move was not without some short-term benefits - his sound wicketkeeping skills and a courageous second Test century on tour in the Caribbean in 1984 encouraged hopes of a long and fruitful stint in the role - it effectively spelled the beginning of the end for his international ambitions.  His productivity with the bat waned so steadily thereafter that his Test and ODI careers were both over within a mere three years.  He subsequently remained a key player in the South Australian team for a number of seasons but his career never again touched the same heights as it had done previously.  Ultimately, Phillips became involved in full-time coaching work at the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide, a role in which he still functions today.

{"country_id": 1, "surname": "Place", "profile": [" Place, Winston, died in Burnley on January 25, 2002, seven weeks after his 87th birthday. He had been the second-oldest surviving England cricketer, having played three Tests on MCC's ill-planned tour of the West Indies in 1947-48. But it was his opening partnerships for Lancashire with Cyril Washbrook, in the seasons immediately after World War II, for which he was most fondly remembered. In their contrasting ways - Washbrook the flamboyant, consummate strokemaker; Place, taller and unassuming, reminiscent of Harry Makepeace in his studied defensive play - they provided a foundation that was the envy of other counties. Not that Place was dilatory or dull. He often outscored his partner on poor wickets and, by the time he left Old Trafford in 1955, he was Lancashire's 13th-highest runmaker with 14,605 runs at 36.69 for the county. Decisive footwork determined his game: he drove effectively through the off-side arc and at times back over the bowler's head, played the late-cut with a delicate touch, and pulled with real aplomb. His roots were in the small mill town of Rawtenstall where, orphaned at five, he was raised by an aunt within a stone's throw of the cricket ground. At 15 he was opening for the first team in the Lancashire League. S. F. Barnes, Rawtenstall's professional from 1930 to 1932, recommended him to Lancashire and at 21, after serving one apprenticeship as an engineer, he went down to Old Trafford in 1936 to begin another. Lancashire's batting was strong, opportunities were limited, but he marked his first season, 1937, by making 137 in four and a quarter hours at Trent Bridge after Washbrook and Paynter had launched the innings with 108 in an hour. Two years on and he was opening with Washbrook when Paynter was injured, impressing everyone with a flawless 164 against the West Indians and averaging 36.11 from 614 runs. He combined war-time work for an engineering firm in Accrington with charity matches and Bolton League cricket for Horwich: in 1944 he and Washbrook gave a sample of treats to come as they put on 140 for the North of England against the RAAF at Old Trafford. Their first two summers together were the best, and Lancashire finished third in both years. Place hit 1,868 runs at 41.51 in 1946, then 2,501 at 62.52 in 1947 with ten hundreds, including two in the Old Trafford match against Nottinghamshire. His 266 not out against Oxford University, in less than six hours, remained the highest of his 36 first-class centuries. Early in that run-sated summer, the Manchester rain frustrated Washbrook and Place as they homed in on MacLaren and Spooner's county-record first-wicket stand of 368, set in 1903. Even so, their unbroken 350 against Sussex outlived them both as Lancashire's second-highest opening partnership - and at the Saffrons in late August they bludgeoned the Sussex bowling once more, each again hitting hundreds as they raced the clock to reach 233 inside two hours (41.4 overs) for a ten-wicket victory. Selection as 12th man for the Leeds Test against South Africa brought Place a taste of international cricket and, with leading England players absenting themselves, he was an obvious candidate for Gubby Allen's side to the Caribbean that winter. It was not the happiest of experiences. Beset by injuries - the 45-year-old Allen got the ball rolling by pulling a calf muscle while skipping on board ship - and underestimating the strength of West Indian cricket, MCC went winless through a tour for the first time ever. Place bruised a knuckle in Barbados in the opening Test and was ruled out of the Second after rupturing his groin muscle while scoring 120 not out against Trinidad: MCC subsequently had four substitutes on the field. The assistant-manager and reserve wicket-keeper, Billy Griffith, was pressed into opening in the impending Test and, on his England debut, hit his maiden first-class hundred (140). By Georgetown, Len Hutton had flown out as a reinforcement and he opened with Jack Robertson while Place batted at No. 3. Innings of one and 15 were no more propitious than his 12 and one not out in Barbados had been, but after making eight in the first innings at Kingston he came good in the second with 107, his only Test century. Not that it helped: England's last six wickets tumbled for 20 runs. \"I got a hundred but we lost,\" Place would recall in later years. He took time to get going in 1948, and his four hundreds, including 200 at Taunton, comprised more than half his runs. A broken hand kept him out for seven games in 1949, though not before he had hit a Championship-best 226 not out at Trent Bridge, and his average was well under par in 1950, Lancashire's Championship-sharing season, when their policy of restricting watering and rolling meant batsmen had to graft for runs at Old Trafford. None of this stopped him passing 1,000 runs, as he did every year from 1946 to 1953. But by 1952, his benefit season, he was lending solidity in the middle order rather than opening the innings. His benefit of \u00a36,297 was then the third-highest for the county after Washbrook's and Pollard's. In 1955 he was 40. And while Washbrook, his senior by a day, was compiling 1,000 runs for the 15th time, Place was managing only 179 in a summer with weeks of continuous sunshine. The Lancashire secretary Geoffrey Howard (qv) remembered him being \"in tears\" when told his contract was not being renewed. Almost 20 years earlier, asked after his first season how he would spend his holidays, he had replied, \"This was the last day of my holiday.\" In 324 first-class matches, all but 26 for Lancashire, he scored 15,609 runs at 35.63, and held 190 catches. He tried to follow the sun by umpiring, but \"One season was enough. I liked the job but I didn't like the evenings on your own.\" He preferred Rawtenstall, where he had a newsagent's, and the warmth of family life with his wife and two daughters in their home by the cricket ground.

What turned the scale was that Laker was bowling off-breaks whereas Lock relied on the left-armer's natural leg-break, and the Australians at that period were wholly inexperienced in playing off-breaks, especially on a wicket which, heavily marled and almost devoid of grass, might have been designed for an off-spinner.

As a consequence of the injury, there were often concerns expressed about his ability to get through a season without breaking down and his cause was not helped when, after bowling particularly well against the 1998-99 West Indians, he underwent an ankle operation. Terbrugge returned to the fray in 1999-2000, however, fit, strong and perhaps a little quicker than he had been previously. A fast-medium seamer very much in the mould of Shaun Pollock, he shares many virtues with the South African captain. Also red-headed, Terbrugge gets in tight to the stumps, bowls an immaculate line and moves the ball away from the bat late. He played four Tests against Brian Lara's West Indians, taking nine wickets, but also doing an exceptional job of tying up an end whenever the ball was tossed to him. Surprisngly, he had to wait until 2000 before making his one-day debut, but when he was brought back into the side again in the Singer Cup, he responded magnificently, claiming 4 for 20 to help bowl South Africa to victory over Pakistan. But he was hit by a variety of injuries and never quite became a regular member of the side. A back injury suffered in the 2005-06 season led to his retirement the following season, at the age of 29.

Though he took time to get going in 1938, a 12-over spell of five for 27 at Worcester and a hat-trick in an eight-wicket match return at Hove showed why Lancashire had been playing him in every game. Then in August he caught fire, beginning with 12 for 125 at Canterbury and reaping 58 wickets in the last nine Championship fixtures.

Moreover, his cricket did not end with his batting. Though he stood only 5ft 6in tall, and had a low, slinging action, he could off a run of eleven strides bowl genuinely fast for a few overs. Admittedly it was a terrible proof of the weakness of English bowling after the war that at this period he often had to open in Test matches.

First appearing for Sussex in 1924, he created a sensation by taking seven for 17 in his third match, in the second innings against Leicestershire at Horsham. Naturally, great things were hoped of him, but he was slow to develop and it was not until 1927, when he made 1,036 runs with an average of 23.54 and took 44 wickets at 26.93, that he began to justify the confidence which the country had placed in him. From then until the Second World War he was an indispensable member of the side. In 1928 he made the first of his 41 hundreds and in 1929 helped Bowley to put up 368 in three hours, at that time a Sussex record, for the first wicket against Gloucestershire; his share was 110. In 1935 he did the double and appeared for the Players at Lord's; that winter he was a member of E. R. T. Holmes's MCC side to Australia and New Zealand, which did not play official Tests. His one Test appearance was against New Zealand at Lord's in 1937, when he opened the batting with Hutton, also making his Test debut, but, though he scored 22 in the first innings and bowled well, he can never have been a strong candidate for a place against Australia. His first-class career ended in 1939. After the War he went to the Lancashire League and later, for a time in the 1960s, was the country coach at Hove.

Indeed, after forty years it is difficult to have any vivid picture of his cricket, except perhaps of his brilliant close fielding. As a batsman he was sound and a particularly good cutter, not very attractive to watch, but capable of scoring fast if wanted. Stockily built, he was for years a formidable opening partner for John Langridge, and had the considerable merit that no fast bowler was likely to intimidate him. He bowled slow-medium in-swingers, which, if there was any bite in the wicket, often moved away after pitching; but again he was normally reliable rather than deadly. He was first of a distinguished cricket family.

In other words, Cullinan tried just too hard to succeed against Australia. Against all other attacks in all kinds of conditions he scored runs, as demonstrated by his century in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Galle in 2000 when his hundred came against Muttiah Mularitharan, the world's best offspinner, operating on a turning track. In 1994, when South Africa were decimated by Devon Malcolm and bowled out for 175, Cullinan made a graceful 94 and was the only South African not to lose his wicket to Malcolm. Equally adept against pace or spin, Cullinan had the priceless gift of timing. He made even a forward defensive prod look stylish. He took some time, it is true, to shake off a reputation earned as a schoolboy as the \"new Graeme Pollock\", a label tagged on him when he broke Pollock's record as South Africa's youngest first-class centurion. During the 1990s, however, Cullinan set the South African mark for the highest first-class score (337 not out against Northern Transvaal in 1993) and at Eden Park in 1999 he edged past Pollock's highest Test score of 274 by one run to claim the then South African record. Cullinan made 14 Test hundreds in all. More importantly, he accepted the role of senior batsman, and it is surely no coincidence that when he scored first-innings hundreds in the first and fourth Tests against England in 1999-00, South Africa went on to win both matches.

Rhodes worked harder than anyone else in a team of hard workers, frequently delaying the team bus at the end of practice for one more round of reflex catches hit from ten metres or less. Nobody has ever fielded better in the key one-day position of backward point, where he leapt like a salmon, threw off balance, and stopped singles by reputation alone. He laboured just as hard over his batting which needed, and underwent, a complete technical overhaul in 1997 - whereupon he averaged 50 for the rest of his Test career, until he gave it up to concentrate on one-day cricket in 2000. The problem was a tendency to bring the bat down from gully and through to midwicket, a legacy of the extraordinary hockey skills that brought him selection for the Olympic Games in 1996 - an offer he had to refuse. Few batsmen have turned the quick single into a finer art form, and his willingness to experiment and adapt enabled him to lead the way with the reverse-sweep under Bob Woolmer's tutelage. But Rhodes was just as likely to delay the bus by relentlessly signing autographs for gaggles of persistent children; the arrival of his own, a daughter, was instrumental in his semi-retirement. Indeed, Rhodes may have become the first cricketer to claim paternity leave. Rightly, there is give and take in Rhodes's life. He has more endorsements than any team-sport player in South Africa's history, is at the forefront of the sporting dotcom revolution, and is constantly exploring the boundaries and horizons of commerce.

I would compare his pace with that of Chandrasekhar, who caused so much trouble last winter in India and who has a similar dip in his flight. I played most of my career with Jim and so much of the fun which I had was contributed by him. There is a wealth of stories one could tell about him. Once against Gloucestershire he was bowling to that magnificently aggressive batsman, Charlie Barnett, and I was fielding at mid-off. Jim had not had the best of luck and the fielding had not been of a very high standard. He came up to me during one over and said out of the corner of his mouth, 'I think I'll bowl Charlie a long-hop, Denis, he might hit it down deep square-leg's throat.' This he carried out to perfection, for Charlie laid back and cracked it straight to Alec Thompson on the square-leg boundary. Unfortunately Alec, who was not renowned for his fielding, moved in too far and the ball dropped over his head and hit the fence. Jim had the sun in his eyes and could not follow the flight,  so he came up to me and said 'What 'appened, Denis' I told him that regrettably Thompson had misjudged it and the ball had dropped over his head for four. After a moment's silence he muttered, 'Should have hit him on the bloody head' - and with that unforgettable smile was off to bowl the next ball. I have been at the wicket on numerous occasions with Jim, who was no mean batsman and did for a time in the early 'thirties open the innings for Middlesex. He could 'prop and cop' effectively, and when the occasion warranted he could give the ball a powerful thump. In one match at Lord's when I was going pretty well it was essential for Jim to play up the line. He beckoned me up the wicket and said, 'Don't do anything silly, Denis. I'll show 'em the maker's name all right.' As usual, it came out of the side of the mouth and, in fact, his manner of speaking was so infectious that I used to find myself talking to him in the same way. He was a great help to me throughout my career, as he was to so many other Middlesex players. Even after his retirement in 1953 he did much, as coach and scorer, for the welfare of Middlesex. One tends to forget his fine record of 1582 first-class wickets - eight times he took 100 in a season and in 1948 all ten in an innings in a festival match at Kingston - because he was such a rare and endearing character.

In fact he played in only two Tests, v Australia at Leeds in 1934 and v West Indies at The Oval in 1939. Probably most people would reckon that the selectors were right, that he was a good county player but not quite Test class. He had a sound defence, was a fine cutter and also had a good cover drive, but what spectators will chiefly remember is his leg-side play and in particular his mastery of that difficult and neglected stroke, the on-drive. Moreover he was, as befitted a first-class soccer forward, a fine outfield. He first played for his county in 1926, but the Nottinghamshire batsmen of that era retained their skill almost undiminished to a patriarchal age and it was not until 1931 that the premature death of Whysall secured him a serious trial. He made the most of his opportunity, scoring his thousand runs with an average of 30 and making two centuries. For most of the season he had the valuable experience of opening with George Gunn. From then for twenty years his career was interrupted only by illness or injuries, of which he had more than his share; in January 1935 he was knocked down by a lorry and was lucky to be able to resume his place in the side late in June. But despite all this and the loss of six seasons in the War he reached his thousand runs on twelve occasions and made 54 hundreds. His highest score, 312 not out in seven and threequarter hours v Middlesex at The Oval ( Eton were playing Harrow at Lord's) in 1939, remains the only innings of 300 ever played for Nottinghamshire, and he is also one of the few batsmen to have scored a century against every county. From 1932 to 1948 his regular partner was that eccentric player, Charlie Harris, and a notable pair they were. On 45 occasions they put up three figures, fourteen times they exceeded 150 and five times 200. Twice they put up 100 in each innings. Their highest stand was 277 v Middlesex at Trent Bridge in 1933. Keeton was still as good as ever after the War, but Hutton and Washbrook had now established themselves as England's opening pair. As late as 1949 he scored 2,049 runs with an average of 55.37. In 1951, at 46, he lost his regular place in the side, but against Kent at Trent Bridge helped Simpson to put on 269 for the first wicket. A single match in 1952 concluded his career.

When he was summoned to the colours against England in February 1951, he seemed to have everything in his favour, not least his personal charm, good looks and grace of movement. He batted stylishly, could bowl offbreaks, and fielded in any position. He seemed to possess all the qualities needed for the captaincy of Australia. Hole was nineteen and playing for the St. George club in Sydney grade cricket when, in 1949-50, he was picked to represent New South Wales against Victoria in what was in effect the Sheffield Shield final. He managed only 23 and 6 with the bat, but taking six for 61 in the match he helped his side win by 196 runs. It was a useful d\u00e9but. That winter, he moved to Adelaide and became an automatic choice for South Australia until he retired in 1957-58. In 1950-51 he made 478 runs in the Shield for an average of 39.83, and in the state's two matches against MCC he batted well, without scoring heavily. Chosen for the final Test at Melbourne, when Australia had already somewhat fortuitously built up a 4-0 lead in the rubber, he made 63 in the second innings but could do little more than delay England's first victory since 1938. He also helped to make it slightly less emphatic by bowling Hutton for 79. In 1951-52, however, he suffered a considerable setback, scoring only 190 runs in nine innings against West Indies. He achieved little of note, apart from 45 not out in the second innings at Brisbane, when he remained imperturbable in a crisis, and 62 at Sydney in the final game, and his form in the Sheffield Shield, until he made a fine century against Queensland, was moderate.

Outside the Tests he fared better against the South Africans, with a well-made 97 for an Australian XIat Sydney and 102 for South Australia in Adelaide at the end of the tour.

Although he continued to help his father, who was a greengrocer and coal merchant, young Harry, inevitably known as 'Ginger' for the colouring of his hair, joined the ground staff at Lord's in 1906, and, having absorbed advice from E.G. Wynyard and others, he developed his allround play to such an extent that Middlesex offered him an engagement in 1911. Three years passed before he made any true impression. This was a fortnight after war had broken out, in August 1914. Promoted to open, he accompanied the brilliant Frank Tarrant to the middle and scored 139. Pasty Hendren and J.W. Hearne also made centuries in that match against Notts, a pointer to the future, for the pair were to bring repeated glories to Middlesex batting, with Lee a valuable regular support. It was a minor miracle that Lee was able to resume cricket at all. Soon after enlisting, he was shot in the leg during the hostilities at Neuve Chapelle and lay for three days between the lines. He was reported dead, and a memorial service was held. However, he had been taken into German custody, and was soon repatriated as a hopeless case. His legacy fortunately was no more than a shortened and slightly withered leg, and a year later he made a century at Lancing. Upon Tarrant's recommendation he secured a position in 1917 as cricket and football coach to the Maharajah of Cooch Behar - and was lucky to see it.

Few visiting captains have been received with so much acclaim by the crowds of Melbourne and Sydney. Although England lost the series by four matches to one, it was soon appreciated that the 40-year-old Brown had almost single-handedly, and against every forecast, done a huge amount to revitalise English cricket, which had been humbled in turn by Australian speed and West Indian spin. What is in many ways a romantic story started when Brown was offered the captaincy of Northamptonshire early in 1949. He called his new charges back for three weeks training before the season began and went on to lead them to sixth place in the Championship--after two years at the bottom of the table. In addition, he was invited to captain England in the last two Tests against New Zealand and, crucially, a year later, the Gentleman at Lord's. A sudden first-innings collapse, the presence of the selectors, and his sense of the occasion put Brown on his mettle. In a wonderful innings of 122, made in 110 minutes, he hit a six and sixteen fours, scoring all but 9 of the runs put on while he was at the wicket. The selectors had no need to look further for the man they wanted in Australia, and he was recalled to lead England at the Oval in the last Test against West Indies.

While, as the vicissitudes of some of our modern Test match batsmen demonstrate, it is impossible to exaggerate the importance of a sound orthodox method, it is salutary that just now and again a player emerges who can defy some of what are normally considered the cardinal principles and yet completely confound the critics. Bakewell's stance was one of the most two-eyed ever seen, with the right shoulder so far round that it seemed almost to be facing mid-on: it was not helped by a slight crouch and he gripped the bat throughout with one hand at the top and the other at the bottom of the handle. Seeing this for the first time, one would have diagnosed a dull and ugly player who would score, if at all, by nudges and deflections. Yet there was in him some natural genius which enabled him to be one of the most brilliant drivers and cutters in the world, nor did he have any difficulty in getting right down the pitch to hit the ball. Naturally he was also strong on the leg side and, if in his early years his defence was a trifle suspect, especially on his off stump, he soon improved it.

Although he was somewhat slower than  Larwood, his line, from left-arm over the  wicket, and the steeper bounce that he obtained from his height, made him formidable enough and the batsmen got no relief when facing him. His job in that 1932-33 series was to maintain the pressure and he did it nobly, taking, besides, fifteen wickets in four matches: he missed the  fourth Test owing to injury. The controversy which this tour excited and the amount that has been written since has diverted attention from his performances in the first two Tests in  1936-37. No English side in this century had had such a bad press before the tour started: it was popularly regarded as having no chance whatever. Its captain,  G. O. Allen, the third fast bowler on the previous trip, had been irredeemably opposed to bodyline and had refused to bowl it: it is worth recording that he himself had by orthodox methods taken eight for 131 in the  third Test. So before the selection of the team was completed the Chairman arranged a meeting between  Allen and  Voce at which  Allen insisted on an undertaking being given that bodyline tactics would not be employed.  Voce demurred at first, but finally agreed to fall in with his captain's wishes and throughout the tour bowled over the wicket to an  off-side field. In the  first Test he took six for 41 and four for 16:  Australia lost by 322 runs and the critics were confounded. The second was even more sensational.  Allen declared (a step almost unprecedented in a timeless Test) at 426 for six in order to get  Australia in on a wet wicket, and with the seventh ball of the first over  Voce had  O'Brien, a left-hander,  caught at  slip: from the next ball  Bradman was  caught at  short-leg. A maiden followed and off the second ball of his next over  McCabe was  caught.  Australia were three wickets down for 1 run and  Voce had taken them all in four balls. The side was out for 80 and, though they got 324 in their  second innings, they lost by an innings,  Voce's figures being four for 10 and three for 66. In addition  Chipperfield had been missed off his bowling in the  first innings. In this match the weather had helped  England, in the next it helped  Australia, who won by 365 runs.

His bowling was ideally suited to the shorter game - a gentle medium-pace that forces the batsman to do all the work allied to subtle changes in pace and the ability to cut the ball either way off the wicket. Harris was also a very safe fielder, particularly within the inner circle and in the covers. He hit a purple patch with the bat in late 1997, going 19 consecutive innings (eight of them in ODIs)  without being dismissed and registering three half-centuries. He also played a vital role in New Zealand's triumph at the ICC KnockOut tournament, putting together a partnership of 122 for the sixth wicket with Chris Cairns to set up a last-over win against India in the final. But, again like Bevan, Harris was unable to carry his undeniable talent into Test cricket and his 23 appearances between 1992 and 2002 resulted in a disappointing batting average of 20.44 and an untenable bowling average of 73.12.

In both those seasons he had a few trials for Leicestershire. At Cambridge he won his Blue as a freshman and retained his place as an opening batsman throughout his four years, being captain in 1927. His performances for Leicestershire showed him to be by now fully up to county standard, and coming down he took over the captaincy and held it in 1928, 1929, 1931 and 1933. He himself always paid a most generous tribute to the help and kindness he received from George Geary. He proved himself, as he had at Cambridge, an outstanding captain, besides being one of the county's most reliable bats. He played for the Gentlemen at Lord's in 1925 and 1927 and was a member of the MCC sides to South Africa in 1927-28 and to New Zealand in 1929-30. He also toured the West Indies with Sir Julien Cahn in 1929. In his first-class career he scored 12,597 runs with an average of 27.09, and made fourteen hundreds.

A man of strong character, he found an ideal head professional in Ernest Tyldesley, and few teams can have travelled as harmoniously as we of the MCC in 1927/8. Our first official function was a lunch in Cape Town at which we heard our captain make his first serious speech. In replying, General Smuts said, in the most graceful terms, that, whilst he expected decent sentiments from honest athletes, he was totally unprepared for oratory on the plane to which he had just listened. It was a tribute earned on every occasion upon which Stanyforth spoke. It was my good fortune to make many cricketing trips with Rony Stanyforth, to Holland, Egypt and to Germany. With his humour, warmth and fibre he was the most entertaining and convivial team-mate yet as captain, though unobtrusively, very much in command of the situation. In the affairs of cricket the same qualities made him a splendid administrator, dauntless in what he regarded as being right, whether popular or not. Wherever he went he had a most unusual quality of commanding respect as well as deep affection.

Born at Woodborough, Notts., on October 31, 1887, he was only 43 at the time of his death. He matured slowly as a cricketer, and not until 1908 was he invited to join the ground staff at Trent Bridge. Two seasons later he made 140 for Notts 2nd XI. at Trent Bridge against Staffordshire, who had Sydney Barnes to bowl for them. While a useful wicket-keeper, he played for the county as a batsman and, though first tried for Nottinghamshire in 1910, he did not realize expectations until ten years later when, after the long break due to the War, he resumed his place in the side. From that time he forged ahead rapidly until he became the most reliable batsman in the XI, a position he held unchallenged last summer when he headed the averages with 47.84 for an aggregate of 1,866. During five consecutive summers he had an aggregate of over 2,000 runs in first-class matches and in 1929 he made 2,716 runs. Whysall possessed unlimited patience and a defence most difficult to penetrate. He could bring off all the strokes known to a modern batsman and, when really set, his pulling and off-driving were very sure. During the summer of 1921 Whysall became the recognized opening batsman with George Gunn and, altogether, the pair took part in forty first-wicket three-figure stands for the county. He was a capable catch in the slips. On the strength of his ability as a wicketkeeper as well as a batsman, he secured a place as deputy to Strudwick in the M.C.C. team that toured Australia under the captaincy of A. E. R.

When England lost the third Test Match by 11 runs, he was the highest scorer with 75 in the great effort to gain a victory. His form, although always consistent, did not earn him a place in another Test match until last August, when at the Oval he had the disappointing experience of being dismissed for 13 and 10 in the prolonged struggle which resulted in Australia recovering the Ashes.

A tall, powerful man, he bowled fast-medium well within his strength, with a short run and a beautifully easy action. His stock ball moved naturally form the off and could be deadly if the wicket helped him, as when he ruined his second benefit, against Warwickshire at Hinckley in 1936, by taking thirteen for 43 (the match produced him \u00a310). This was varied by a delivery which came straight through and, a far more dangerous ball, the leg-cutter which pitched on middle-and-leg and left the bat sharply. This was the one which the experts dreaded and which secured the all-important wicket of Bradman, caught at slip for 29, in the Nottingham Test of 1934. Apart from this he could make full use of the shine to swing the new ball. Yet with all these gifts, he will probably be remembered chiefly as a stock bowler who would peg away cheerfully all day if need be, keeping the situation under control whether or not he was getting wickets. As a batsman he never claimed to be a stylist, but he was typically effective: the more runs were needed, the more resolutely he would set himself to get them, not least by punishing ruthlessly anything which fell short of his very high standards of what first-class bowling should be. In his last season, at the age of 45, when an injury prevented him from doing his full share of bowling, he scored three centuries. He was a fine slip, but in fact his vast hands were equally tenacious anywhere: in The Oval Test of 1926, besides two blinding slip catches off Larwood, he caught a brilliant one low at mid-off off Rhodes to dismiss Arthur Richardson.

By his early death English cricket lost, not only a notable exponent of the game, but a man of rare charm. Few modern professionals commanded such a measure of esteem and kindly regard from his own immediate colleagues and his opponents in the cricket field as did Roy Kilner. He was modest to a degree concerning his own abilities, and generous in his estimate of those he played with and against. Kilner's cricketing life consisted of two separate and distinct periods. Before the War he was essentially a batsman, Yorkshire having such a wealth of bowling talent that the need for him to exploit this part of the game did not really arise. The death of M. W. Booth--killed at the Battle of Lens, just before which Kilner himself was wounded in the right wrist--followed, after hostilities had ceased, by that of A. Darke, and the retirement of George Hirst, brought about a considerable change in Yorkshire's strength in attack. Without neglecting his batting, Kilner turned his serious attention to bowling, but the season of 1922 had dawned before he became one of the leading left-handed bowlers in the country and an all-round player of marked ability. His powers as a batsman were a little slow to ripen, for, although he gained a place in the Yorkshire eleven in 1911, not until two years later did he firmly establish himself. Left-handed, as in bowling, Kilner could, if necessary, play a dogged game, but that was foreign to his temperament, and he will always be remembered by his rather aggressive methods. He drove with considerable power on the off-side and pulled very hard. For Yorkshire he put together fifteen 100's, and in all matches for his county scored 13,014 runs with an average of 29.91.

Although he played either side of the Great War, the bulk of his career came after and he topped the Somerset averages for five seasons out of six between 1921 and 1926. He also won a Blue at Cambridge in 1920 after going there after the war - he was wounded and captured at the battle of Couteau in August and spent the war as a POW in Holland where he played a lot of cricket. A good hockey player, he was in the British side that won gold at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics. ", " Jack MacBryan, who died a few days before his 91st birthday, was England's oldest surviving Test cricketer. Captain of cricket at Exeter School, he was in the XI at the RMC Sandhurst when he played for Somerset in their last two matches in 1911 and against Surrey at The Oval was second-top scorer with 20 in a total of 97. In the next three years he made a few appearances for the county and in 1914 scored 61 against Gloucestershire. But in August that year he was wounded in the right arm at Le Cateau and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner, latterly in Holland, where he was able to play plenty of cricket. In 1919 he was up at Cambridge, but, though he scored 90 against the Navy, was only twelfth man at Lord's. However, he topped the Somerset averages and indeed did so in six of the eight seasons 1919-26. He duly got his Blue in 1920. His two best years for Somerset were 1923, when he made 1,507 runs for them with an average of 37.67, and 1924, when his aggregate was 1,355 and his average 43.70. By now he was near the England side. In 1923 he made top score, 80, for the Rest against England in the Test trial at Lord's and in 1924 was picked for the Gentlemen at Lord's, and again made runs in a Test trial. As a result he was selected for the fourth Test against South Africa at Old Trafford, but the match was ruined by rain and he did not bat. Many expected him to be in the side for Australia, but his chance was probably lost when the doctors passed J. W. Hearne as fit. In any case, the team was overweighted with openers: in addition to Hobbs and Sutcliffe, there were Sandham, Whysall and J. L. Bryan. Instead MacBryan went with the Hon. L. H. Tennyson's unofficial side to South Africa, where he was only moderately successful. Two more seasons for Somerset virtually concluded his career. Though he continued to play occasionally until 1931, he was never after 1926 in sufficient practice to do himself justice, and so, like many other amateurs, he dropped out just when he was at his best. Short but strongly built, he was primarily a back-foot player and a fine cutter and hooker. He also played well off his legs and was a far better bat on a turning wicket than most amateurs. Moreover, lack of inches did not stop himcountering Tate at his best by playing forward and getting well over the ball. In all his movements he was neat and elegant. In the field his wounded arm prevented him throwing far, but he was good near the wicket, especially at short-leg.

{"country_id": 1, "surname": "Carr", "profile": [" Arthur Carr, who died at Leyburn, Yorkshire, on February 7, personified the South countryman's idea of a Northern cricket captain. This, however, was a matter of character rather than heredity, for he was the son of a London stockbroker, was born in Surrey and went to school at Sherborne. Tall, wide-shouldered, with a high forehead, eyes constantly narrowed - as if in appraisal - strong mouth and firm jaw, he took his cricket grimly, as though it satisfied some hugely combative streak in him. Unwavering once he had taken a decision, he was never one to suffer fools gladly, nor a believer in the soft answer to turn away wrath. He went out of first-class cricket rather than change his opinion. Arthur Carr was one of the three finest batsmen ever produced by Sherborne: oddly enough, he was captain of every game there except cricket; but he was good enough batsman to be given a match for Nottinghamshire in 1910, a year before he left school. He scored his first county century in 1913, but his effective first-class cricketing career began when he became captain of Nottinghamshire in 1919. His captaincy had the firm foundation of playing ability. He was a fierce straight driver, at his most spectacular against pace bowling. He would step down the wicket to hit men as fast as J. M. Gregory and Maurice Tate back over their heads: indeed, Maurice Tate once said that Arthur Carr hit him consistently harder than any other batsman he ever met. But, unlike many who excel against pace, Carr was sound against flight and spin, and regularly made good scores against the best spin attacks of his day. He had, moreover, a sound defence, for he played very straight and used his feet well. In a career spread over twenty-five years, he scored 21,100 runs with 45 centuries, made a thousand runs in each of eleven seasons and averaged, overall, 31.58. Fielding with hostile concentration near the wicket - slip, gully or short-leg - he took 316 catches. But it is as a captain that Arthur Carr is most memorable. Decisive, relentless, compelling respect from his own players and from his opponents. During the sixteen years of his captaincy, Nottinghamshire won the Championship for only the second time since 1886, were nine times in the first four and never held a double-figure position. They have not approached that standard since Carr went. Wisden once referred to his Notts team as `Mr. Carr and the professionals who support him so well'. For years the only amateur in the side, he had either to remain aloof, in the manner of Lord Hawke, or, cutting across the etiquette of the time, mix in completely with his professionals. Carr took the latter course, proved as hard, and as hard a drinker, as any of them, but never lost a scrap of his authority. He was an aggressive captain. He was fortunate that, throughout his career, he had invariably had three fast bowlers - of Matthews, Barratt, Larwood, Voce, Butler and Flint - in the side. He used them in short spells, flat out, to attacking fields, with immense effect. Carr played for England throughout the series in South Africa, 1922-23 and, in 1926, captained England in the first four Tests against Australia. At Leeds, where the selectors - not Carr - left out Charles Parker on a wet wicket, he won the toss and put Australia in to bat. Bardsley was caught at slip, off Tate, from the first ball of the match: off the fifth ball of the same over, Carr dropped Macartney, or Australia would have been 2 for 2 wickets. In the event, Macartney scored a century before lunch and the second wicket put on 235. During the fourth - Old Trafford - Test, Carr became ill with tonsilitis: although he had recovered in time for the final Test - in which England recovered The Ashes - the captaincy was given to Percy Chapman.  Carr was bitterly disappointed at being deposed and, although he was made a Test selector in 1928 and captained England in two Tests with South Africa in 1929, he threw his main energies into driving Nottinghamshire up the Championship table.  Neither Douglas Jardine nor Arthur Carr are alive to relate precisely the genesis of the tactic variously described as `fast leg-theory', `direct attack' or, as it is now remembered, 'bodyline'. But certainly it was a product of a discussion between those two, for, under Arthur Carr's direction, Voce and Larwood employed - and perfected -  the method in English county cricket during 1932, before the controversial tour which effectively ended the career of more than one of the participants. In 1934, a section of the crowd at Trent Bridge demonstrated against the Australians, on behalf of their two local bowlers, whom they believed to have been ill-treated. Arthur Carr stood, uncompromisingly, with Larwood, Voce and their supporters. Bitter dissention within the club led to the captaincy being taken from him. He accepted membership of the committee and declared himself available for the county in 1935: but he never played for Nottinghamshire again.  Instead, he moved to Yorkshire and turned to his other major interest, horse-racing: for some years he had horses in training at Middleham. Arthur Carr virtually cut himself off from the cricket world until recent years, when the old bitterness had grown less sharp, and he would turn up at Trent Bridge, as a welcome guest, at Test Match time. There is little doubt that he enjoyed himself, but he maintained a public front of tight-lipped and cold-eyed withdrawal: he never believed in showing sentiment.

Leaving school at the age of fifteen, he embarked on a career as a journalist which commenced with a cadetship at the Sydney Daily Guardian. Later, he was to move to the Telegraph Pictorial where he worked for several years prior to the Second War. At the outbreak of war, he joined the Army before being seconded to the former Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, as Press Secretary. From this time onwards, he lived and worked in Canberra.  Fingleton achieved no particular distinction on the cricket field while at school, but, on joining Waverley, he quickly graduated to the first eleven of a club which included  Kippax,  Carter,  Hendry and  Mailey within its ranks. A right-hand opening batsman,  Fingleton was noted more for his stubborn defence than for his aggression. The one epithet unfailingly used to describe his batting was  courageous. He was also an outstandingly gifted fieldsman, whose reputation was made in the covers but who was later to win fame with Vic Richardson, and sometimes with  W. A. Brown, in  South Africa in  1935-36 as part of the O'Reilly leg-trap.

He was 81. Born in East St. Kilda, Melbourne on Aug. 11, 1907, Edward Lambert a' Beckett, 6 ft tall, came from a distijnguished legal and sporting line, and the needs of his profession (law) restricted his cricket at toplevel. At 21, after only six first-class matches, he was drafted into the Australian XI soon after Jack Gregory's breakdown against England in 1928-29, and distinguished himself on the second day of his Melbourne debut by scoring a confident 41 and adding 86 for the seventh wicket with 20-year-old Bradman (79) and then dismissing 45-year-old Hobbs, who snicked a widish ball, before close of play. It was a'Beckett's only wicket, and he took only Sutcliffe's at Adelaide, where England went four-up after four. His two Tests brought him 2 for 216 and 104 runs (some of them `crude', according to P. G. H. Fender) in four innings, though his catches to remove Hendren and Hammond (200) at Melbourne were brilliant, the first at mid-wicket from a full-blooded pull, the second at mid-on, flinging himself to his left as Hammond rounded a ball from offspinner Blackie. He lost his place for the fifth Test, won by a resurgent Australia, but secured a berth to England with Woodfull's youngsters in 1930, having been first in the national bowling averages in 1929-30, not only alphabetically but statistically: 28 wickets at 14.71. He was also 15th in the batting, helped by an innings of 152 for Victoria at Adelaide. He played in only one Test in England, the third, at Headingley, while Bradman scored in 334: A'Beckett was at the wicket when The Don was caught behind to make Australia 508 for 6, and went on to 29. But his fast-medium bowling, if hard to get away, was unpenetrative. He managed only Duckworth's wicket for 66 off 39 overs in the match, but again attracted praise for his fielding, catching Hobbs at silly mid-on. On the entire tour he scored 454 runs (25.22) and took 23 wickets (28.96) having missed a month through illness. He played in one more Test, against South Africa at Melbourne in 1931-32, before his legal pursuits took the Melbourne University graduate away from big cricket. He made no mark on that much, and finished with figures of 143 runs (20.43) in his four Tests, his three wickets costing 317 runs. In all first-class cricket he scored 1636 runs at 29.21 and took 105 wickets at 29.16 (6 for 119, v NSW, Sydney, 1927-28, his best return). A'Beckett's weightiest batting performance, 113 and 95, was somewhat overshadowed by the world-record 10th-wicket stand of 307 by New South Wales batsmen Kippax and Hooker over Christmas 1928. Not only did he come within a stroke of making twin centuries in that extraordinary Melbourne match, but he ended the amazing last-wicket resistance by having Hooker, the No. 11 caught for 62.

Morally, the figure might be 12: he was the bowler at  The Oval when  Hutton was given out for obstruction after impeding  wicket-keeper Russell Endean as he tried to take a simple catch.  Hutton rated  Rowan almost as high as  Laker.  Rowan's achievements were the more remarkable since his leg was damaged by a wartime explosion: he was unable to put his full weight on the front foot, often bowled in pain, and sometimes in leg irons. In his way, he was as courageous as his famously feisty older brother Eric, but Athol's way was more good-humoured and quiet. He also suffered slightly different privations on the  1947 tour:  England was still in the grip of rationing, and  Rowan was a famous trencherman. Before the war, he had bowled fast-medium. When he came back, having escaped from the Germans when taken prisoner in the Western desert, he turned into an  off-spinner while retaining something more like a seam bowler's grip. His most dramatic performance came at The Wanderers in  1949-50, when he took nine for 19 as  Transvaal bowled the mighty  Australians out for 84. Set 69 to win,  Transvaal were bowled out for 53 themselves.

He succeeded to the great Lancashire county tradition of opening batsmen - Hornby and Barlow, MacLaren and Ward, MacLaren and Spooner, then, after the 1914-18 war, Makepeace and Hallows, Hallows and Watson. In the summer of 1928 in consecutive games Hallows and Watson opened a Lancashire innings with scores of 200, 202, 107, 118, and accomplished first-wicket partnerships during this same season twelve times amounting to 100, four of those to 200. Charles Hallows, nephew of James Hallows, a superb all-round player in the MacLaren high noon, first came into the Lancashire XI in 1919, and soon established himself. He was a left-handed batsman who combined great obstinacy with recurrent strokes of rare style, ease, and mastery. His straightdrives were classic. But, in his period, Lancashire batsmen put forward their finest strokes according to the plan of campaign mapped whenever Lancashire won the toss on a good wicket. The plan envisaged 300 runs on the first day, enough, as a rule, to give scope for pushing home to victory by bowlers as top-class as Parkin, McDonald, Richard Tyldesley, Hopwood. Harry Makepeace was the tactical power behind the throne. If the occasion happened to be Lancashire v Yorkshire at Old Trafford - gates closed at 11 am first day - and if Lancashire had won the toss in dry weather, the Makepeace dictate was: `Now, lads, wicket's lovely. No fours before lunch!' In those years a score of 300 in a day was considered tedious. I often `slated' Lancashire, in my reports, for such `slow' play; I often `slated' Hallows if he scored a century in four, or three-and-a-half, hours. I did not know, in the 1920s and 1930s, what was coming to us. Today, Charles Hallows would be my first or second choice, were I a selector, as opening batsman for England. In 1928 he compiled 1000 runs in a single month - May. In his career he scored 55 centuries, two in one match. But only twice was he chosen to play for England in Test matches - at Old Trafford in 1921, when he batted merely to put an end to a draw with Australia; and in 1928, at Lord's against West Indies, when, in first, he scored 26. Hobbs and Sutcliffe barred the front entrance of the England innings for years. Before radio and television blew the bubble of cricketers' reputations, the name of Charles Hallows was a household word in the North. He played in great company - Rhodes, Macaulay, Sutcliffe, Leyland, Makepeace, Ernest Tyldesley, Parkin, Percy Holmes. In a Lancashire v Yorkshire engagement of Hallows' epoch you would see a dozen Test cricketers in action - seven or eight in the same Lancashire XI. Hallows stood erect in the several circumstances of comparison. Also, he could break a partnership by left-arm bowling of graceful rhythm. I think he had the potentiality of a spin bowler. He preferred to go in first for Lancashire, to defend with a quite fascinating, sometimes exasperating, compound of dourness and lithe, effortless power and brilliance of strokeplay.

{"country_id": 1, "surname": "Fender", "profile": [" Percy Fender was the last survivor of those who had played county cricket regularly before the Great War: more important, he was one of the most colourful figures in the cricket world for many years after it and was widely regarded as the shrewdest county captain of his generation. In a career of 26 years he scored 19,034 runs with an average of 26.66, took 1,894 wickets at 25.05, made 21 hundreds and caught 599 catches. Six times he did the double. But he was not a cricketer who could be judged on figures. Wisden has never been a slave to statistics and, when in 1915 he appeared as one of the Five Cricketers of the Year, it was after a season in which both his bowling and batting averages had been approximately 23 and he had not scored 1,000 runs nor taken 100 wickets. Yet the honour was fully deserved. Surrey had won the Championship and Tom Hayward had said that Fender was the making of their XI. In a crucial match, for instance, against Kent, the reigning champions, at Lord's in August (The Oval was occupied by the military), going in on a pitch made for Blythe, who took nine for 97. with a scoreboard reading 147 for four, he made 48 in twenty minutes, thus securing Surrey a lead of 94: he also took in the match five for 43 and thus played a big part in his side's victory. But besides his batting and bowling, Surrey that year owed much to his superb slip fielding. Their bowling, not strong for a champion county, depended largely on Hitch, who was fast, and Rushby, who was fast-medium, and on the perfect Oval pitches a dropped slip catch could easily mean a lost match.  Throughout his career Fender's policy was to hit fiercely, regardless of the state of the pitch, even of the quality of the bowling. He was a tremendous driver and also delighted in the pull, and he cut or slashed ferociously outside the off stump: he once slashed the ball over cover out of The Oval. It was difficult to set a field for him. His century in 35 minutes against Northamptonshire in 1920 remains a record, though it was equalled in farcical circumstances in 1983. His highest score, 185 against Hampshire in 1922, took 130 minutes and against Kent later that season he made 137 in an hour and a half, 52 of them off fourteen consecutive balls. It was not to be expected that one batting on these principles would be as consistent as a more sedate player, but in the very strong Surrey batting sides of those days another solid bat would have been neither here nor there: Fender the hitter was invaluable.  His attitude to bowling was the same. His object was to get the batsman out, and the tactics fostered by the modern one-day game would never have suited him. He had at his command a great variety of pace, spin and swing and all were fully employed. Inevitably his length sometimes suffered. Yet it was unwise to assume that because a batsman was out to a full toss it was a lucky wicket almost as likely as not it was bowled for that very purpose. Probably he was least expensive when he concentrated on leg-breaks and googlies. Whatever he was bowling he had a wonderfully sharp eye for a batsman's weak points. There can be no doubt that his best role was as the fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side. Unluckily this was a part he was seldom able to play, and for much of his time in the Surrey team he had to do the work of a stock bowler. As such he did wonders, but to borrow a phrase used by W .G. in a different context, he \"never hadn't ought to have been put to it\". His most spectacular bowling performance was against Middlesex at Lord's in 1927, when his analysis read 5.3-2-10-7; eleven balls produced six wickets for 1 run.

In 1914 he was not so successful in batting, but he obtained 141 wickets for Yorkshire at a cost of 18 runs apiece.

Ken Vilioen's quiet determination, an insistence on the right sort of discipline, and their combined appreciation of the value of fielding laid the foundations of a success beyond anyone's wildest dreams. The Australian tour wisely led to the same combination bringing the team to England in 1955. Again, understanding and discipline of the same kind brought success.

He bowled mostly left arm round with considerable swing, and could break the ball back to hit the stumps, but most of his victims were caught in the leg trap.

At Lord's he had England in deep trouble at 80 for six, and finished with five for 89 in the innings. ", " praised his rare ability, endless courage, and his out-swinger, though the team was hopelessly overmatched, and he was over-bowled. That was often the way: he was on the winning side in only four of his 28 Tests. But he played a crucial role in blunting the threat of Hanif Mohammad in the 1960-61 series against Pakistan. Hanif had some trouble against Desai's deceptive bouncer, and was dismissed by him four times in nine innings: the Indians joked that he was Ramakant's bakra- the Hindi equivalent of rabbit. With the older ball, Desai was especially effective. His finest hour arguably came in that series, at the Brabourne Stadium in the opening Test, when he scored 85, batting No. 10; his ninth-wicket stand of 149 with P. G. Joshi remains an Indian Test record. He also scored a crucial 32 not out at Dunedin in 1967-68, continuing to bat after his jaw was broken. India won, but he never played Test cricket again. In 53 Ranji matches for Bombay, he took 239 wickets at 15.61, and he retired completely in 1969, aged only 30. Desai returned to the front line in 1996 when he was appointed chairman of selectors, and he was responsible for the appointment - and the dismissal - of Sachin Tendulkar as captain. It was not a happy term of office, and his natural sense of loyalty and reticence, combined with increasing ill-health, made it difficult for him both in committee and in his dealings with the media.

Although he played 14 Test-taking 65 wickets at 21 apiece-in a first-class career from 1907 to 1926, Whitty never became a familiar name in cricket. Perhaps overshadowed by more glamorous players, he had an extraordinary record of success against the brightest star of his day, Victor Trumper. He bowled against Trumper in five SA v NSW Sheffield Shield matches three times Trumper was not out, and in every one of the other seven innings, Whitty dismissed the great batsman. It was ironic because Whitty had been introduced to big cricket by Trumper himself. Born in Sydney on August 15, 1886, Whitty played only junior cricket but was noticed by Trumper, and recommended for coaching and then to bowl against the State squad. At 21 he played his first match for NSW against Queensland at Sydney, took three wickets, and the following season was recruited by Clem Hill to move to Adelaide. In 1910 he bowled for the first time against Trumper, his hero, and dismissed him for 75 and a `duck'. In succeeding meetings he got Trumper for 47 and 37, then Trumper had two brief not-out innings, was dismissed by Whitty for a duck and eleven, made a brilliant 201 not out, and was finally bowled by Whitty for 25. His greatest Test success came in the home series of 1910-11 against South Africa when he took 37 wickets at an average of 17. The second Test at Melbourne saw the South Africans needing only 170 for victory-and Whitty wrecked them with an irresistible 6 for 17 off 16 overs.

{"country_id": 2, "surname": "Jones", "profile": [" Opinions differ considerably on the question, Who was the best fast bowler? The passing of Ernest Jones, the noted Australian bowler who came to England with the  1896, 1899 and 1902 teams has raised again this absorbing topic. One of the few cricketers of long experience who can speak on the subject as an authority is the old Cambridge and England captain and Yorkshire player, Sir Stanley Jackson. He readily accepted an invitation to a chat, and has been good enough to agree to his opinion being set down in Wisden. Of all the fast bowlers the Australians have sent to this country, I think Jones was the best in my time. I have very good reasons for remembering him, as I took part in the first match he played in this country against Lord Sheffield's XI at Sheffield Park, Sussex, in 1896. He was one of the most powerful men I ever met. I believe he was a miner, and in his early days of the tour was very wild in his delivery. This was probably because the Australians came practically straight off the ship to the match and were short of practice. Jones gave me the impression that his main effort was to show his immense pace. The wicket was dry and he bowled short, bumpy stuff. I went in first with W. G. Grace and we had to dance about a bit. One ball from Jones hit W. G. under the arm, and later in the innings another one went head-high past him and over Kelly's head to the boundary. This was the ball about which the Beard Story originated. I can see W. G. now. He threw his head back, which caused his beard to stick out. Down the pitch went W. G., stroking his beard, to Harry Trott and said: \"Here, what is all this?\" And Trott said: \"Steady, Jonah.\" To which Jones made that famous remark: \"Sorry, Doctor, she slipped.\" I do not think the ball actually touched W. G.'s beard. That story was told after-wards, and I believe I was responsible. When I was out and returned to the Pavilion, I said: \"Did you see that one go through W. G.'s beard?\" The ball was bouncing, and only Ranji appeared to like it. The pace that Jones was bowling impressed me because in the second innings, when I had made about 10, I had the misfortune to stop one with my ribs, but with the assistance of W. A. J. West, the umpire, who rubbed me, I was able to continue my innings. When I went to London I had a good deal of pain, and my father sent for the doctor, who said, \"It's cracked horizontally.\" He strapped me up, and I did not play for three weeks. Within a month of Sheffield Park I faced Jones at Lord's in the M.C.C. match, and he came up to me and said, \"I am terribly sorry\", and he clasped my hand in a vice-like grip that left me wondering which was the more painful--my hand or broken ribs. Following those early incidents, Harry Trott took Jones in charge and changed him into a very fine bowler. He made him shorten his run and taught him the value of length and control. Jones developed a beautiful action. I believe it has been suggested that he threw, but this I personally regard as absolutely absurd. At that time, the action of some bowlers was not fair, and Sydney Pardon, by his campaign in ", ", did valuable work towards stamping out the trouble. I think it is often forgotten that bowlers, well supported by the field, are the match-winners. You can generally find plenty of batsmen, but genuine bowlers are scarce. Although I never played against him, I would say that Larwood appeared to me the best fast bowler I saw. I have a great admiration for him, with his beautiful rhythmic run and a perfect action which gave him complete control over pace, direction and length. It was these qualities that made him such a fine bowler. I think that he achieved this because at the moment he delivered the ball he was poised high in the air with his left shoulder well up and pointing towards the wicket. It was then that he was complete master of himself, and the control at the end of his run gave him time to deliver the ball the way he wanted. Jones was similar.  Tom Richardson and Lockwood were great bowlers. Lockwood appeared to me the more difficult of the two owing to his ability to change his pace imperceptibly. He had more kinds of deliveries, and his variety, with an occasional very fast ball, made him great. I think Cotter for a few overs was a bit faster than Jones. Kortwright was generally regarded as the fastest bowler of his time in this country. Not only was he a very fast bowler, but also a very good one. While on this subject of bowlers I am very sorry that, besides Jones, another old Australian friend, Charles Turner, has passed away. I always regarded Turner as the best medium-paced bowler I ever played against. He had a graceful run and lovely action, with clever change of pace. I recall my first Test match (1893) at Lord's; I had made 91 when, late cutting one from Turner that kept lower than I expected, I was splendidly caught by Blackham. It was a grand catch. His gloves must have been almost under my bat, and he remarked \"Bad luck, youngster. It is one of the biggest flukes I ever had.\" In that innings England scored 334, and Turner's analysis was: 36 overs, 16 maidens, 67 runs, 6 wickets. We are now thinking of cricket after the war and the best way to improve it. One of the most vital things is the preparation of wickets, and here Jones comes into the story again. The practice of artificial preparation was started by Apted at the Oval in 1899, and he had every excuse. There is very little soil there; within three inches, I believe, you come to gravel. It was the final Test Match, and Hayward (137) and I (118) each made a hundred. We scored 185 for the first wicket in two hours fifty minutes. During our stand Jones, who altogether bowled 53 overs and took four wickets for 164 runs, came to me and tossing the ball up in the air, let it light on the pitch. Instead of bouncing a bit, it stopped dead, and Jones said: This is going to ruin cricket. So, you see, as far back as then we had our problems. Unfortunately one cannot lay down a set rule for making pitches because nearly every ground requires different treatment, but we must try to prepare pitches so as to provide a more even struggle between the bowler and batsman without making the conditions dangerous. In Yorkshire we never put on anything artificial following the end of March. After that, merely roll and water. We used to get real sticky wickets. I remember the time at Sheffield when a side that made 70 against us on a sticky wicket did well because we had such bowlers as Schofield Haigh, Wainwright, Peel, Hirst, Rhodes and myself. Yes, I used to bowl, and I enjoyed it more than batting.  In 1902 at Leeds, F. S. Jackson and Hirst dismissed the Australians in the second innings for 23, each taking 5 wickets. Jackson's analysis was 7-1-12-5. The last four wickets fell to him in five balls. Hirst's five wickets cost nine runs. Each took four wickets in the first innings, Jackson's costing 30 and Hirst's 35. The two bowlers were mainly responsible for Yorkshire winning by five wickets. The Australians only other defeat that season was in the Test Match at the Oval when England won by one wicket. "], "known_as": "Ernie Jones", "fullname": "Ernest Jones"}

He started his cricket career as a wicketkeeper-batsman but converted to a bowler when the regular opener for his club side failed to turn up.  He took the new ball, six wickets, and never looked back. He toured England in 1957 with only one first-class game to his name, but he struggled for form and with his run-up and looked unimpressive.  Called into the side to tour India and Pakistan in 1958-59, he took 46 wickets in eight Tests, and he was a regular thereafter. In the classic Tied Test on 1961 at Brisbane he took 9 for 203, and bowled the last over with six runs were needed for victory with three wickets left. He took one wicket, dropped a crucial catch, and there were two run-outs.  Against India in 1961-62 he grabbed 27 wickets at 15.74 and in 1963, partnered by Charlie Griffith, he blasted England into defeat. At Lord's, in another epic finish, he bowled unchanged for three-and-a-half hours and took 4 for 93 (as well as breaking Colin Cowdrey's arm).  In 1964-65 his 16 wickets were instrumental in guiding West Indies to their first series win over Australia, but by the time he toured England in 1966 the signs were there that he was on the wane.  He retired, along with his partner Griffith, at the end of the tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1968-69.

He went home, given up as incurable, and the end came as a release from his sufferings. Born on August 16, 1872, Mr. Jones played his first match for Notts against Lancashire at Trent Bridge in 1892. Helping Notts to a victory by six wickets, he at once gave proof of his brilliant qualities as a cricketer. The match was a remarkable one. Notts--a great side that season--had 222 to get to win. As he had made 17 not out in the first innings, Jones was selected to go in with Shrewsbury, and between them the two batsmen scored 75 for the first wicket, putting their side on the high road to victory. They might have done more, but a brilliant run out ended the partnership. Jones was then up at Cambridge, but he only played once against Oxford at Lord's, being on the winning side in 1893.

A fast bowler good enough to be selected for England purely in this role, a superlative cover fielder, Jessop is best remembered for his thrilling batsmanship. To quote HS Altham \"no cricketer that has ever lived hit the ball so often, so fast and with such a bewildering variety of strokes\". By no means a big man at 5'7\" and 11 stone, he was a powerful driver, fierce cutter and hooker, but could also play delicate late cuts and glances. In his best innings he scored at rates of close to 100 runs/hour. He debuted for his native county, Gloucestershire at the age of 20, and arrived at the wicket to save a hat trick by striking his first delivery in county cricket for 4. His great innings included 286 in less than 3 hours, 157 runs in an hour against the West Indian team of 1900, and famously, the century that won the Oval Test of 1902. Going in with England 48/5 he made 104 out of 139 in 75 minutes, taking England to an improbable victory. Originally a fast bowler, he strained his back when overbowled in his first Test match in 1899, and afterwards was less effective. As a fielder, the power and accuracy of his returns from cover combined with fleetness of foot made him the undisputed master of that position prior to the Great War. Named after WG Grace, he eventually followed him as captain of Gloucestershire, and later club secretary. Originally a school teacher, Jessop married an Australian met on the boat returning from the 1901-2 tour (his son later played for Hampshire), and in later years moved to London where he wrote and was secretary to a golf club. Due to poor health he retired young, but lived to over 80. "], "known_as": "Gilbert Jessop", "fullname": "Gilbert Laird Jessop"}

Stephenson, most famous of coaches, that in 1893 he scored 722 runs, including 117, 145 and 183 not out consecutively. In the last effort against Repton he carried his bat through the innings.

He progressed in excellence, 35, 80, 77 and 115 being his best efforts in the four successive matches against Oxford at Lord's. It is interesting to recall that E. Rockley Wilson scored a hundred (118) in the 1901 University match, the only instance of two brothers accomplishing this for Cambridge, while H. K. Foster, with 121 in 1895, and R. E. Foster, 171 in 1900, set up a similar record for Oxford--all four innings being played in the course of seven years.

His selection was initially viewed with suspicion by the local media, who regarded Aftab as something of a one-day cowboy, and indeed his desire to belt the cover off the ball has resulted in some all-too-brief performances. His potential, however, is plain to see, and his selection for the seminal tour of England early in 2005 was evidence of the selectors' faith, which he repaid at Chester-le-Street with a defiant, carefree 82 not out, the highest score for Bangladesh in the Test series. He also finished off the historic one-day win over Australia at Cardiff, smashing Jason Gillespie for four and six to seal victory. His medium-pacers have potential as well, as he showed with an astonishing one-day haul of 5 for 31 against New Zealand in November 2004.

A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion.   But it is somewhat surprising that Ervine is playing cricket at all, as a freak accident in his early teens - he slipped and fell on a broken glass in his family's living room - required a three-hour reconstructive operation to his right hand. The injury had been so severe that amputation was considered an option in the initial diagnosis. Ervine's recovery from the injury focused his ambitions, and mid-way through his A level studies at Lomagundi College on the outskirts of Chinhoyi he won a place at the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy. Ervine soon found his way into the Midlands, and Zimbabwe Under-19 and A sides before heading to England to expand his horizons and improve his game.   After spells with English clubs Bexhill and Lordhood, and a stint with Irish club Lisburn in Belfast, Ervine returned to Zimbabwe and took up a contract with Masvingo-based franchise Southern Rocks. Ervine was their leading run-scorer in the 2009-10 Logan Cup and topped their one-day averages as well. His returns in the domestic Twenty20 competition were more modest, but a call-up to Zimbabwe's squad for the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean followed.    Ervine's returns from Zimbabwe's trip to the Caribbean in early 2013 suggested a career heading in the right direction. He averaged 60.50 in the ODIs against West Indies, and was the leading run-scorer across all three formats on the tour. When Zimbabwe returned home, however, Ervine refused a paltry winter contract offer from ZC and instead left the country to play club cricket for Lisburn and Grade Cricket for Morley in Western Australia. It appeared another bright talent had been lost to Zimbabwean cricket, but after an 18-month break Ervine once again made himself available for Zimbabwe ahead of the 2014-15 season. The 2015 World Cup was surely a motivation for his move, and Ervine was included in Zimbabwe's squad for that tournament."], "known_as": "Craig Ervine", "fullname": "Craig Richard Ervine"}

A tall seam bowler, he hits the pitch hard and can get good away movement - but as with many young quick bowlers consistency is his major problem. Technically, he has a good action but a better brace of his front leg through his delivery stride would allow him to make the most of his height, rather than collapsing as he tends to do at the moment. He made his ODI debut against England in October 2004 and caused the England top-order a few anxious moments. His early Test appearances did not set the world alight, and he lost his place after taking 3 for 343 in four matches - but he has the basics and anyone with a semblance of talent should be encouraged and nurtured. Mpofu has benefited noticeably from Heath Streak's appointment as Zimbabwe's bowling coach as his action has smoothed out, his outswing is becoming more consistent (although he still has a frustrating propensity to go too wide of off stump) and his pace has increased. One definite shortcoming, however, is his crease occupation. Not content with being stumped twice in an afternoon (for a pair) in the first Test against New Zealand in August 2005, he followed up by being run out for 3 in the second match, as he strolled down the pitch to congratulate his team-mate on reaching his half-century.

But he played some important little innings, and his 47 and 25 in the low-scoring match against West Indies at Auckland in 1955-56 were instrumental in securing New Zealand's First Test win. He was often prolific in provincial cricket: at one stage of the 1952-53 season he had scored 397 for Central Districts without being dismissed. Miller latter moved to Wellington. He also played first-class rugby. "], "known_as": "Lawrie Miller", "fullname": "Lawrence Somerville Martin Miller"}

The second, in the following season, caused a lot of debate. West Indian opener Allan Rae had scored 10 runs in a Test match in Auckland when he could have been run out by yards.

{"country_id": 4, "surname": "Marshall", "profile": [" Although Roy Marshall gained more prominence through his exploits as Hampshire's flamboyant opening batsman, his brother Norman, six years his senior, was a valuable allrounder for Barbados and, briefly, for Trinidad during a lengthy career that coincided with the emergence of West Indies as a genuine force in the world game. He overcame a discouraging debut for Barbados, aged 17 (out for 0, batting No.11, and conceding 100 runs from 15 wicketless eight-ball overs against Trinidad) to develop into a sound batsman and a quickish, miserly offspinner. When Roy joined him at Barbados in 1946, aged 15 years nine months, then the West Indies' youngest first-class cricketer, Norman was already established in a powerful team that featured an emerging triumvirate of prolific batsmen known as the Three Ws. According to Jeffrey Stollmeyer, he was \"the steadiest offspinner in West Indies cricket at the time\" and unlucky to be omitted from the inaugural tour of India two years later and to England in 1950. Indeed, he was chosen only once for West Indies, against Australia at Georgetown in 1955, aged 31. The circumstances of Norman's selection reflected the haphazard nature of West Indies cricket prior to the creation of the Shell Shield as an annual regional tournament in 1966. His previous first-class match, for Trinidad, where he was then working, against Jamaica, had been two months earlier when he received notice of his call-up on return from one of his regular deep-sea fishing trips. Australia won the Test by eight wickets and, although Marshall justified his inclusion with match figures of 46.3-22-62-2, he was promptly dropped. He signed off the following year with an even 100 and seven wickets in his penultimate match for Barbados, against EW Swanton's team of county players, among them Colin Cowdrey, Tom Graveney, Micky Stewart and Frank Tyson. His executive position with the Singer company subsequently carried him to Peru and Venezuela where he played as much cricket as the expatriate communities afforded, always with the same fierce competitiveness he showed in more illustrious company. On his return to Barbados, to join the directorate of the island's largest company, he turned out in the lower divisions for his original club, Wanderers, well into his 50s, joining the club's occasional touring teams to England, led by his close friend, Peter Short, a former West Indies Cricket Board president.

He played over a span of twenty years for his country, beginning with the Triangular Tournament of 1912 and bowing out with the tour to Australia of H. B. Cameron's team of 1931-32 when he was rising 43. He took part in ten series in all, leading South Africa in four of them, and in 42 Test matches made 2936 runs with an average of 4077. In terms of length and distinction of performance it could be said that no-one ever served South Africa better. Herby Taylor made seven hundreds in Test cricket, six of them on matting pitches, and it was on the mat that he first established himself, in 1913-14, as the youthful captain of a South African side that was considerably out-gunned by the full strength of England at a vintage time. The confrontation between Sydney Barnes, who took the record bag for any rubber anywhere of 49 wickets, and Taylor, who averaged 50 in his ten Test innings against him, is always remembered as one of the classics of history. 'The English cricketers were unanimous that finer batting than his against Barnes at his best they never hoped to see,' says H. S. Altham, while Ian Peebles, who as a young man played two rubbers against him in South Africa, wrote of him in ", " that he was `the ideal model for all aspiring batsmen'. Perhaps his most extraordinary triumph was at Durban on that 1913-14 tour in the only game in which MCC were beaten. Natal made 153 and 216, and Taylor, keeping Barnes's bowling to himself as much as he could, contributed 91 and 100. The basis of his play was the straightest of straight bats, nimble footwork, and an almost unfailing judgment of length. His method was so sound that he remained a beautiful player when nearer fifty than forty, and it was in this autumn of his career that I met him and played a little with him. He was an inexhaustible cricket talker, and despite his own playing orthodoxy propounded unusual theories. One recalls him holding genial court under the oaks at Newlands, and at Lord's during frequent visits to England. He was a man of much charm and that modesty regarding his own achievements which is so often a virtue of the great. Growing up in the aftermath of the Boer War, he belonged to a generation devotedly loyal to England, and won the Military Cross in the war of 1914-18.

{"country_id": 3, "surname": "Pegler", "profile": [" Sid Pegler was much better known as a player in England than in his own country. This arose from his spending some 25 years as a District Commissioner in Nyasaland, as it then was, which put an end to his regular first-class cricket after the 1912 tour to England. Indeed, although he continued to play up to 1930 his last appearance in South Africa itself had been as long before as 1912-13, when he played in one game only. As against this he was in the 1924 team to England and played more domestic cricket in England when back on leave than he ever played in South Africa though, unhappily, not much in either country. This was a great loss to South Africa for he would have been an early choice for the 1913-14 Test team (the Barnes tour) and probably for the teams in the early 1920s also. In all he played in only 16 Tests. Although Pegler had only limited success in Australia, he was a great success in England in 1912, one of the very few South African successes. Tall, strong and fit - and, though it has no bearing on the matter, handsome also - he was admirably equipped to bear the brunt of the bowling. In fact he was given little rest. He played in 34 of the 37 first-class matches and took 189 wickets, the highest ever by a South African. His success extended to the Tests also. Although South Africa were heavily beaten in five of the six Tests, he took 29 wickets at the modest average of 21, including 7 for 65 against England at Lord's. Lord's, and particularly when bowling from the pavilion end, provided him with some of his finest performances. Earlier, against MCC he had taken 6 for 44. On the 1924 tour he took 8 for 54, his best bowling performance, against MCC and, to cap a remarkable series, in his very last match in 1930, for MCC he skittled out Wales with 4 for 14 and 6 for 62. He was then just 42. Pegler was not in the original team selected to tour England in 1924 but by a happy chance was on the same ship as the team, with some months leave ahead of him. Permission was sought, and granted, to include him if he was fit and in form. What the team would have done without him is painful to contemplate. Without repeating fully his 1912 success, he took 108 wickets, second only to J. M. Blanckenberg with 119. The team was even weaker than in 1912, perhaps the weakest ever sent overseas by any country. This time Pegler could not repeat his 1912 Test successes, but his total `bag' of nine Test wickets was still the highest of the team. Pegler subsequently made a third trip to England in 1951 as manager, and it is a sad commentary on a splendid player that he was associated with three of the least successful South African teams to tour England. A right-hand medium-pace bowler with an easy action, a high delivery and clever pace variations, Pegler relied mainly on a quick break from the leg, though he sometimes brought one back from the off. Though he was not a recognised batsman he occasionally made useful runs fast. Indeed his 50 in 14 minutes for the South Africans against Tasmania at Launceston in 1911 is one of the fastest half-centuries on record.

His education was received at Green and Sea Point High School, Cape Town, and his earliest big success on the cricket-field was an innings of 180 for Pretoria v. Potchefstroom. He was a great batsman, having many strokes and a strong defence, and a good field, but he never visited England.

This is not entirely surprising since Trott, who created many a vivid memory for opponents and spectators alike, was apt to be forgotten when it mattered most. The Australian selectors forgot him - or ignored him - when they picked their team for England in 1896, though only a year earlier he had burst into Test cricket with unparalleled force. He so far forgot himself in his benefit match in 1907 that he took four wickets in four balls and then the hat-trick, winding up proceedings foolishly early at a time when people were prepared to roll up in their thousands to pay cash tribute to a stalwart of county cricket - as long as the match lasted. And the forlorn, untended mound which is his grave at Willesden is the decisive pointer to the final neglect into which Albert Trott's name was to fall. His brother, G. H. S. (Harry), was already a powerful influence in Australian cricket when young Albert was given his colours and played in the last three Tests in Australia in 1894-95. He took 8 for 43 and scored 38 and 72, both not out, at Adelaide. At Sydney he batted only once and made 85, again undefeated; oddly, this time he had no chance to bowl. Then in the series climax at Melbourne his figures were rationalised with ten for twice out and one wicket for plenty. Still he stands highest in the batting averages for Australia v England with 102.5. And some would argue that this is not altogether such a freak or exaggeration as it seems. Whatever his loss of form in the next year, he should have been in Harry Trott's side to England; but he was not, and we shall never know the real reason. Instead, he came independently, encouraged by Jim Phillips, the umpire/talent scout; Middlesex were soon to be grateful. In 1899, the year he hit M. A. Noble over the Lord's pavilion, he passed 1000 runs and took 239 wickets. In 1900 he did much the same, and was acknowledged as just about the finest allround cricketer on earth. His batting was powerful, boisterous, and never quite as dependable after the monstrous blow off Noble. His massive hands held practically everything within reach. And his bowling, slung with a round-arm delivery, contained most of the arts. Warning against his fast ball was seldom sufficient insurance, and his slower ball had batsmen fanning at air. He actually played for England - on the tour of South Africa in 1898-99, when he left his mark with 17 wickets at less than twelve apiece in the two Test matches; but as the seasons went by, his body spread under the effects of ale - often taken along the boundary from admiring spectators - and from dropsy, which also induced melancholia. He became an umpire in 1910, but by 1914, living alone in digs, `Albatrott' had had enough. He wrote a will on the back of a laundry ticket, leaving his wardrobe and \u00a34 in cash to the landlady.

From his look of robust health no one could have seemed better assured of a long life. Board had a highly-successful career, but yet did not take quite the place that in other circumstances might have been his. He was a fine wicket-keeper--fearless and untiring--but never the best in England, and for this reason his appearances in representative elevens were few. It is from his connection with Gloucestershire cricket that he will be remembered. Coming out as a wicket-keeper for Gloucestershire in 1891 he held his post right on without a break till 1914. As he succeeded Mr. J. A. Bush, who, curiously enough, died a few months after Board, we have the interesting fact that Gloucestershire depended on two wicket-keepers for over forty years. As time went on Board developed his batting to such a remarkable extent that in six seasons-- 1900, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1909, and 1911--he made over 1,000 runs, his highest score being 214 against Somerset at Bristol in 1900. He had perhaps no special distinction of style, but his defence was sound, his hitting very hard, and his pluck unflinching. Board went only once to Australia, going out with Mr. Stoddart's second team in 1897-98. As wicket-keeper for that unsuccessful side he was simply the understudy to William Storer, and did not take part in any of the Test Matches. He had more prominence in trips to South Africa in 1898-99 and 1905-6. For several winters he did excellent work as a coach at Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, and in matches there hit up scores of 134 and 195. In 1921 Board became one of the regular umpires in county matches, and was on the list at the time of his death. He took his benefit at Bristol in 1901, the Surrey match being allotted to him. It is an interesting fact that Board kept wicket in a first-class match before appearing for Gloucestershire, taking part in the North and South Match for Rylott's benefit at Lord's in 1891. Quite unknown at the time, he passed through a severe ordeal with great credit. The first of his appearances in Gentlemen and Players' matches was at the Oval in 1896, and his last at Lord's in 1910.

He first played for Sussex in 1890, and remained a regular member of the county side until 1912. In the following year he secured a place in the list of first-class umpires. While playing for Sussex, Butt was responsible for the dismissal of 1,202 batsmen, catching 927 behind the wicket, and stumping 274. He also made one catch while fielding at slip. In his first season for Sussex, when playing against Cambridge University at Brighton, he allowed only one bye while the University hit up a total of 703 for nine wickets. In four consecutive games, all at Hove in 1895, he allowed only six byes whilst 1,938 runs were being made. His best season as a batsman was in 1900, when he scored 652 runs for an average of 27. A year later he made his highest score in first class cricket--96 v. Worcestershire at Hove. When he carried out his bat for 74 against Cambridge University, at Cambridge in 1908, he and George Cox added 156 for the last wicket. Short of stature, but very quick on his feet, Butt excelled more in catching than in stumping. His hands, unlike those of some of the most famous wicket-keepers-- Blackham, Pilling, Lyttelton, McGregor, and Strudwick--were badly knocked about, but he maintained his form year after year in remarkable fashion, and he possessed an unsurpassed reputation for fairness. Against Somerset at Brighton in 1900 he made eight catches, and in the game with Kent at Tonbridge in 1899, when Bland took all to wickets, Butt brought off four catches in each innings. In four other matches, all for Sussex, he made six catches in a single innings. In 1894 he represented the Players against the Gentlemen at Hastings, and in 1895-6 toured South Africa as a member of Lord Hawke's team. As wicket-keeper for Sussex he followed Harry Phillips, and he was succeeded by G. B. Street, who early in 1924 met with a fatal accident when motor-cycling. As an umpire Butt ranked very high. He was quiet, but very firm, and was generally respected. Eloquent testimony to the great esteem in which cricketers held him was shown by the action of the First Class County captains at their meeting on December 10. On learning that Butt, owing to illness, did not offer himself for appointment for next season's matches, they asked the secretary of the M.C.C. to write to Butt on their behalf to express their deep regret at the cause of his retirement.

{"country_id": 1, "surname": "Brown", "profile": [" Jack Brown died at Dr. Kingscote\"s Medical Home in London, on the night of November 4, of congestion of the brain and heart failure. A statement appeared a few days before his death that there were hopes of his recovery from the heart trouble which in May terminated his cricket career, but other complications set in, and despite all that medical skill could do for him, the Yorkshire batsman passed away. As he was only in his thirty-sixth year he might, under happier circumstances, have gone on playing for a good many seasons to come. Still, during the time he was before the public he did enough to earn a place among the best cricketers Yorkshire has ever produced. He came out in 1889, and from the first showed such promise that no doubt was felt as to his ultimate success. Bad health checked him for a time, but in 1893 he firmly established his position, and henceforward, allowing for the variations of form to which all batsmen are subject, he was, till his health broke down, one of the mainstays of the Yorkshire eleven. Even so recently as 1903 he stood second to Geroge Hirst in the Yorkshire averages in county matches. Short in stature, but very strongly built, he was a batsman who could get runs under all conditions of weather and wicket. He was an all-round hitter, but his best stroke was his late cut. Few batsmen since Tom Humphrey\"s time have been able to score with greater certainty from the short ball pitched on, or just outside, the off-stump. About half-way through his career he developed a wonderful faculty for pulling,but this so often cost him his wicket that he to a large extent gave it up and returned to the ways of orthodoxy. Neat and finished in style, he was, whether he scored fast or slowly, an excellent bat to look at. Of his performances for Yorkshire and other teams it would be easy to write at great length. Having regard to the surrounding circumstances, his greatest day in the cricket-field was, beyond all question, March 6th, 1895, when, at Melbourne, he and Albert Ward won the fifth and conquering Test Match for the first of the two elevens that Mr. Stoddart captained in Australia. The Englishmen had 297 to get in the last innings, and after the second wicket had fallen for 28, Stoddart himself being out from the first ball bowled on the final morning, Ward and Brown put on 210 runs together. Their partnership settled the matter, and in the end England won by six wickets. Brown made 140, and all the reports of the match agreed in stating that his innings was absolutely free from fault. Only those who have seen the Australians fight out a Test game can fully realise the merit of such a display. If he had done nothing else, that one innings would have been sufficient to give Brown a place in cricket history. All through the tour he was a great success in Australia, and Mr. Stoddart certainly made a mistake in not taking him out with his second team in 1897. One of the best innings Brown, ever played at home was his 163 in the Gentlemenand Players\" match at Lord\"s in 1900, when the Players, though they had to make 501 runs, won by two wickets. Brown was batting for four hours and three-quarters, and only gave one chance. His innings remains the highest ever obtained for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord\"s. For Yorkshire against the Australians, at Bradford, in 1899, he made 84 and 167. His biggest scores were 311 for Yorkshire against Sussex at Sheffield, in 1897, and 300 for Yorkshire against Derbyshire at Chesterfield, in 1898. On the latter occasion he and Tunnicliffe scored 554 together for the first wicket-a record partnership in first-class cricket. At Lord\"s in 1896 for Yorkshire against Middlesex, he and Tunnicliffe did an extraordinary thing, making 139 for the first wicket in the first innings, and afterwards winning the game by scoring 147 together without being separated. Brown only played twice for England against Australia in this Country-at Lord\"s and Manchester, in 1896. At Lord\"s he had a considerable share in winning the match for England, batting with great skill for 36 in the last innings, after a heavy shower in the morning had spoilt the wicket. Personally, Brown was a quiet, pleasant-mannered man, and did not lack the sense of humour proverbially characteristic of Yorkshire cricketers. His benefit match at Leeds, in 1901, was the biggest thing of the kind ever known prior to George Hirst\"s benefit at the same ground last year.

He will live in cricket history as perhaps the finest of all fast bowlers. Among the only men who can be placed with him are George Freeman, John Jackson and William Lockwood. Many famous batsmen, among them Ranjitsinhji, contend that on his good days Lockwood was more difficult to play than Richardson, but for consistent excellence there was no comparison between the two bowlers. While he was at his best - from 1893 to 1897 inclusive - Richardson scarcely knew what it was to be out of form. Allowing for the excellence of the wickets on which he had to bowl, it is quite safe to say that his work during those five years has never been surpassed. Too much was exacted from him, but he ought not to have gone off as soon as he did. He began to lose efficiency before he was 28, and though for a year or two longer he did brilliant things he was never again his old self. A great increase in weight rather than hard work was responsible for his comparatively early decline. Looking at the matter in the light of after events, it was no doubt a misfortune that he paid a second visit to Australia. When in the autumn of 1897 he went out with Mr Stoddart's second team, he was at the top of his fame, having just completed a wonderful season's bowling. In English first-class cricket in 1897 he took 273 wickets for less than 14\u00bd runs each. One remembers that when Mr Stoddart's team sailed from Tilbury, Maurice Read was full of forebodings as to the effect the tour might have on Richardson's future, thinking that a winter's rest after his strenuous labours would have been far better for him than Test matches on Australian wickets. After Richardson came home his falling off was plain for all to see. He took 161 wickets in first-class matches in 1898, but his bowling had lost its superlative quality, and only in two or three matches at the end of the season - notably against Warwickshire at The Oval - was he the old Richardson of the previous year. He continued to assist Surrey for several seasons, playing for the county for the last time in 1904.

Later in 2003 he was the leading wicket-taker in the series against England. He can bat a bit too, usually employing the long handle. His 77 at Hyderabad in May 1998 was instrumental in Bangladesh's victory over Kenya - surprisingly, their first in seven attempts - while in May 2004 he carved an astonishing 111 from No. 9 to help secure a precious first-innings lead against West Indies in St Lucia. His 5 for 65 helped Bangladesh win their first Test, against Zimbabwe at Chittagong early in 2005, and he also played a vital role in turning around the one-day series that followed.

{"country_id": 6, "surname": "Adhikari", "profile": [" Hemchandra 'Hemu' Adhikari was, in some ways, the nearly man of Indian cricket. He was nearly a leading batsman, he was nearly the best No. 7 batsman India produced (he also batted at No. 3), he scored nearly 10,000 first-class runs, claimed nearly 50 wickets and took nearly 100 catches and was captain of the national side only once. Had Adhikari's connection with cricket ended in 1959, when he was overlooked for the tour of England, that might have served as his epitaph. It was in his second career - as the national coach - that Adhikari rose to his full potential. He was the team manager and the brain behind India's first series win in England in 1971. He shaped the career of cricketers in a two-decade period that saw the rise of, among others, Sunil Gavaskar, Mohinder Amarnath, Dilip Vengsarkar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Ravi Shastri, Kapil Dev and Syed Kirmani. A brilliant cover point in his time, Adhikari was a hard taskmaster who placed physical fitness above all - a concept that was new to Indian cricket which traditionally had been served by talented players who could bat or bowl like a dream, but often escorted the ball to the boundary while fielding. The Second World War delayed Adhikari's Test debut until he was nearly 29 and his official army duties restricted his appearances to 21 of 47 Tests played in his time. A fine player of spin bowling, he made up for a weakness against genuine pace with a large heart that made him the man for a crisis. He was in Indian teams that played inaugural Tests against Australia, West Indies and Pakistan, and his best performances came against these three teams. At Adelaide he made 51 and helped Vijay Hazare add 132 for the seventh wicket while six batsmen failed to score. His only Test century came against West Indies at Delhi in 1948-49 while his 109-run stand with Ghulam Ahmed for the last wicket against Pakistan four years later remains an Indian record. In the notorious home series against West Indies in 1958-59, when India had already used three captains in the first four Tests, Adhikari led in the fifth. He made 63 and 40 and claimed the wickets of Conrad Hunte, Basil Butcher and Denis Atkinson with his gentle leg-breaks. That was his final Test. At 40, he felt he was not up to touring England - where he had acted as vice-captain on India's 1952 tour - again. He was not invited to and DK Gaekwad led the team that lost all five Tests. Adhikari was not a big man yet he was a presence. He will be remembered for his role in Indian cricket's self-confidence movement that began with that series win in 1971.

Despite being a superb timer of the ball off both the front and back feet, he was slow to learn the ability to build a big innings and his selections were due almost entirely to his outstanding potential rather than actual performance. He has a very sound technique, but poor shot selection has often brought about his downfall. Coach Kevin Curran noted that he matured well on the West Indian tour in May 2006.

This was against West Indies in 2000-01 when, batting at No. 3 instead of his normal opening position, he scored a composed 119 that was largely responsible for Zimbabwe saving the match after conceding a first-innings lead of 216. Earlier in the year he had not only become the youngest Zimbabwean ever to score a first-class century, but also the first black player in Zimbabwe to do so - a watershed moment in the country's history.   A year later, though, he put his professional cricket career on hold as he began a three-year course at the University of the Free State. Although an agreement was reached that he would still be available for Zimbabwe if required, he could not maintain his form playing against club opposition in South Africa, and the national selectors initially decided to await his return to the country. But the Rebel crisis led to his early recall in the one-dayers against England where, unsurprisingly, he struggled before registering his maiden ODI fifty in the final game. His return to the Test match team brought mixed results, but he was Zimbabwe's best batsman, technically, on their tour of South Africa, where he showed an application lacking in his team mates.   After being criticised for not being able to score quickly enough early on in his career, Masakadza's ability in one-day cricket has steadily increased and 2009 was a bumper year for him.

As a fresh-faced 23-year-old he flew Lancasters for the RAF during the Second World War. According to his crew, Rabone and his men several times side-stepped disaster or death and, when his luck ran out, he parachuted from his crashing bomber into the arms of a French family who hid him until the liberation of 1944. The other side of the Rabone wartime personality was the fun-loving lad, quick to smile, who loved a beer and a sing-song amid the strong fellowship that warfare brings.  So it was with his cricket. Rabone had many arts - solid batsmanship, useful medium-pace bowling, occasional legspin and long fingers that curled round many brilliant slip catches. He may not have been of Test quality in any cricketing art but few could match his determination. Rabone was 27 but perhaps lucky when he joined the New Zealand side which toured England in 1949. He did well as the spare-parts player - batting anywhere between No. 1 and No. 7, bowling spin and snaffling 24 catches. The 49ers, led by Walter Hadlee, Merv Wallace, Tom Burtt and Martin Donnelly, were a happy bunch but their time was up and the early-50s men like Rabone, John Reid and Bert Sutcliffe had to fashion a new side to face the hard-headed power of West Indies, England and South Africa at home and South Africa on tour.

Yet before, during and after his brief career Mooney was an astonishing character - possibly the most colourful character New Zealand cricket has known. Mooney loved the outrageous risk, the impromptu punt on whatever took his and his band of friends' fancy. As a cricketer Mooney was a stylish `keeper and a batsman so determined to make the most of his modest talents that during playing hours he would be as silent and serious as a tomb. Which explained the fact that when the stumps were up Mooney's alter ego, nicknamed Starlight, would be out twinkling round the bars and dance floors of Wellington. Not long after his cricket career finished in 1954-55, Mooney re-emerged in the public eye after a spectacular five-figure bet. To win, Mooney had to drive the 410 miles from Auckland to Wellington in under seven hours. In those days the roads were indifferent and mostly back-country. Mooney had a cool planner's brain behind his gamester face. He had a powerful Jaguar engine further super-charged. He arranged for seven petrol stations to be open at small hours of the morning. He started about midnight, rocketed through the night, and was in Wellington about six-and-a-half hours later - without being cited by the traffic police. Inevitably, the news of Mooney's stampede leaked out. Politicians and senior traffic officers were mightily embarrassed. Mooney forestalled what might have been a manhunt by owning up, paying a modest fine (a small percentage of the bet) on the police belief that at some stage he must have exceeded 100mph. Not long afterward Mooney, by now in his forties, and his friends were arguing about the merits of Olympic champion runners Peter Snell and Murray Halberg, both Kiwis, and the magic of the four-minutes mile. No magic, said Mooney. He could run a mile in under five minutes. The betting money poured in. Mooney gained a month to prepare, had an expert design him a four-week crash course training programme - and won the bet with seconds to spare. Mooney had his ups and downs, in cricket, business and life. If there remained one regret it concerned Lawrence Rowe, the West Indian batsman. Mooney, then a national selector, accompanied New Zealand on the 1971-72 tour of the West Indies. After Rowe, little-known outside Jamaica, had scored 227 for Jamaica against the tourists and 214 and 100 not out in the first Test, Mooney was quickly acclaiming Rowe as the `next Bradman'. Mooney rather implied that he had `discovered' Rowe as a world-class player. Sadly for Mooney, and perhaps world cricket, Rowe did not complete that 1972 series, and later illness did not allow Rowe's genius to develop.

More than once in his early years he proved a thorn in the side of Yorkshire, enjoying a particular triumph at Bramall Lane in 1885 when taking 13 wickets, including five for 13 in one innings, at a cost of 48 runs. The strain upon his elbow entailed in imparting a leg-break troubled him so much that after a few seasons he took to bowling off-breaks, which he did with considerable success.

The Brighton wickets were at their best in his day and they suited his style of play to perfection. He had a most brilliant cut and--the boundary being short on the pavilion side--it is no exaggeration to say that he got numberless fours without running a yard. One of his performances stood out above all the rest. Playing against Notts at Brighton in 1891 he scored 145 not out and 92. In 1891 he touched his highest point. He headed the Sussex averages and stood for the moment in quite the front rank of professional batsmen.

He captained Pakistan in their First Test match in 1952 and was at the forefront of events from then until he resigned from the Pakistani Board in 1977 in protest against Government interference. But he was a Test cricketer before Pakistan even existed, playing for India on the 1946 tour of England under the name Abdul Hafeez. After the tour he added the family name Kardar, stayed in England and went to Oxford to read PPE and enhance his reputation as an idiosyncratic and fearless cricketer: a left-handed batsman, whose response to any bowler or situation was to dance down the track first ball and slam it back over the bowler's head, and a left-arm medium-paced bowler, economical on a good pitch, devastatingly effective on a bad one. Kardar had a couple of productive seasons with Warwickshire, where his successes included marrying the club chairman's daughter, then returned to Pakistan to take on the captaincy. He had learned well under Martin Donnelly and Tom Dollery and, as Test cricket's newcomers, Pakistan at once made themselves worthy of respect rather than anyone's sympathy. In 23 matches as captain, Kardar led his team to victory over all the then Test-playing countries except South Africa, whom they never met. He then became chairman of selectors, and president of Pakistan's Board of Control from 1972 to 1977. In all his positions of authority, he was inclined to be dictatorial and quickly angered, especially by any hint of criticism. In some ways, his prickly brilliance has become characteristic of his country's cricket. But he was also a visionary. He ruthlessly modernised the organisation of the Pakistani game, and many of the themes he was advocating in the 1970s have become common currency among modern administrators: the need to do away with unwieldy committees, to break the post-imperial dominance of Lord's, and to expand the game in Asia. He was an early advocate of neutral umpires. Little of this was well received by his colleagues on ICC at the time. In later years he removed himself from cricket and his last public role was as Pakistan's ambassador to Switzerland. Diplomacy may not have come easily to him.

Two years later he played in both Tests against the South Africans in New Zealand and in the first made 54. However by 1937 he had developed into a good medium-pace opener who could swing the ball and get considerable pace from the pitch.

Even so, with 62 wickets at 26 runs each and 510 runs with an average of 25.50, he was an extremely useful member of the side, especially, as he was a brilliant slip. Moreover he had a way of getting runs when they were wanted; in the Lord's Test he made 66 not out and at the Oval 50, both very valuable innings which left him at the top of the Test match batting averages. The second Test he had missed through injury. His highest score during the season was 82 v Sussex. He was no stylist, but had a strong defence and could hit hard in front of the wicket.

He stooped a little but had a great variety of strokes with great freedom in his use of the bat, and was exceptionally strong in driving. He bowled right-hand, rather below medium-pace, with considerable spin and well-concealed change of flight and pace. He used to send down with much effect a slow ball, very high-tossed, which, seeming to be coming well up to the batsman, pitched short, and resulted in many a  caught and bowled. It was expected that Giffen would have charge of the Australian team which toured England in 1886, but his merits as a leader were not commensurate with his merits as a player. Giffen first visited England in 1882 as a member of the team which beat England at the Oval by 7 runs. As the side included Spofforth, Boyle, Garrett, and Palmer--four of the finest bowlers of the time-- Giffen was overshadowed, and while they averaged l50 wickets at a cost of less than 13 runs each, he had to be content with taking thirty-two wickets for 22 runs each. Still, he had a brilliant success against the Gentlemen of England at the Oval, where he took eleven wickets for less than 10 runs each--eight in the first innings for 49 runs--and contributed largely to a memorable triumph. Nor had his batting powers at that period fully developed, but his record of 873 runs with an average of 18 was a vastly bigger thing than it would be regarded on the easy wickets of to-day.

He had his most vivid experiences in  England in connection with matches in which he did not personally meet with much success. He was not only on the side that in 1878 made the fame of Australian cricket for ever by beating MCC at Lord's in one afternoon, but he took part in the Test Match in this country at The Oval in 1880, and also in the unforgettable match on the same ground in 1882, when the Australians beat us by seven runs. Indeed, the catch -- quite an easy one -- by which he got rid of WG Grace in the last innings proved the turning-point of that tremendous struggle. Alec Bannerman among Australians was the most famous of all stonewalling batsmen; his patience was inexhaustible. It was said that the Sydney public had become tired of his super-caution when Lord Sheffield's eleven were out in Australia in 1891-92, and were inclined to barrack him, but that everyone spoke of him as Good old Alec, when he took seven hours and a half to score 91 in the match that gave the Australians the rubber against the Englishmen.

He was further identified with English cricket when he acted in the same capacity for the Hon. Ivo Bligh's side which went out to Australia in our winter of 1882-3.

{"country_id": 2, "surname": "Boyle", "profile": [" Henry Frederick Boyle, more than anyone else, except Spofforth and Blackham, made the fame of the first Australian XI in England in 1878. He was a Sydney man by birth, but he went to live in Victoria when only three years old, and with Victorian cricket he was always associated. He took to the game when quite a small boy, and at the age of fifteen he played for twenty-two of Sandhurst against Victoria. When in December, 1873, W. G. Grace\"s eleven played their first match at Melbourne, Boyle appeared for the Eighteen of Victoria, who beat the Englishmen in a single innings, and to the end of his life he recalled with pride the fact that he bowled down W.G.\"s wicket. In addition to Boyle, the Victorian team included Frank Allan, Thomas Horan, B. B. Cooper-so well known in England a few years earlier as a batsman-W. Midwinter, John Conway, the manager of the Australian eleven of 1878, and the once famous bowler Sam Cosstick. It is no injustice to Boyle to say that he was a far greater cricketer in England than in Australia. When he came to this country in 1878 he was not regarded as anything like such a good bowler as Allan, but whereas he enjoyed a triumph, Allan gave way before the rigors of a very ungenial summer, and only once or twice did himself justice. It is a very old story now to tell how Spofforth and Boyle on the 27th of May, 1878, dismissed the M. C. C. for totals of 33 and 19, and in one afternoon established for good and all the reputation of Australian cricket. In the eleven-a-side matches of that memorable tour Boyle took 63 wickets, coming out a very respectable second to Spofforth who took 123. Visiting England for the second time in 1880 he did not have many opportunities in first-class matches, the Australian programme that year, owing to the unfortunate incident at Sydney during the tour of Lord Harris\"s eleven in 1878-79, being largely restricted to games with local eighteens. Boyle however, made the most of such chances as he enjoyed. Indeed, he perhaps never bowled better than when, towards the end of the season, Spofforth\"s accident threw the whole responsibility upon him and George Palmer. In the England match at the Oval the two bowlers got five wickets down for 31 runs, when Englandwent in with 57 runs to get in the last innings. It was, however, in the great tour of 1882, that Boyle reached his highest point. He bowled down the last wicket when the Australians gained their famous victory by seven runs against England at the Oval, and in the eleven-a-side matches he took 144 wickets, finishing at the top of the bowling averages with Spofforth, Palmer, and Garrett below him. The tour of 1882 was the climax of his career. From that time his powers as a bowler began to wane. In 1884, when for the first time he experienced a real English summer, he only took 67 wickets as against 216 by Spofforth, and 132 by Palmer, and in 1888, when Turner and Ferris did such wonderful things, he was quite an unimportant member of the team. He paid his last visit to England as manager of the 1890 eleven. Boyle as a bowler relied mainly upon headwork and accuracy of length, and had no very remarkable break. Like Alfred Shaw, though his style did not in any way resemble that of the English blower, he was satisfied if he could make the ball do just enough to beat the bat. No one was quicker to discover a batsman\"s weakness, or more persevering in turning his knowledge to account. He could peg away at the wicket for an hour without ever bowling a bad ball, and he was never afraid of pitching one up to be hit. No doubt his very high delivery helped to make him deceptive in the flight and awkward in his quick rise off the pitch. Apart from his bowling, Boylewill be remembered as perhaps the most daring fieldsman Australia has ever produced. The position he made for himself at short mid-on was not of much use on very fast wickets, but on the slow grounds in 1878, 1880 and 1882 he brought off any number of catches. Moreover, the mere fact of his standing so dangerously close in, caused many English batsmen to lose their wickets. Of course he got some ugly knocks at times, but he was quite fearless and did not mind how hard the ball was hit at him. E. M. Grace is proud of the fact that he alone gave him a fright and caused him to stand further back. "], "known_as": "Harry Boyle", "fullname": "Henry Frederick Boyle"}

Born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1894, Nunes learnt his cricket at Dulwich College in South London, where by a quirk of fate he was a contemporary of two future England captains in Arthur and Harold Gilligan. In the First World War, he served in France as a Captain in the West India Regiment, after which he returned to his native Jamaica and helped ready the region for Test status. In 1923, he was named as vice-captain for the tour to England but led the side for the majority of matches due to the illness of the nominated leader, Harold Austin. Five years later he returned to lead the team in his own right - and keep wicket as well - for their inaugural Test at Lord's. England won by an innings and 58 runs, but Nunes' finest hour came in his fourth and final Test, two years later, in Kingston. Set an unobtainable 836 after Andrew Sandham had made 325 in England's first innings, Nunes and a 20-year-old George Headley batted for five-and-a-half hours to salvage a famous draw. Nunes's share was a Test-best 92 in a record second-wicket stand of 228. In the course of his playing career Nunes became the first West Indian to score a century against an England touring team (140 not out v MCC in 1926) and the first to score a double-century against any overseas team (200 not out v Hon Lionel Tennyson's XI in 1927), but after retirement he remained hugely active as an administrator. He was a member of the Jamaica Cricket Board of Control from its inception in 1926, and from 1945 to 1952 he served as President of the West Indies Board, during which time the team really established itself as an international force with victory on the tour of England in 1950. From 1947-51 he was West Indies' representative to the Imperial Cricket Conference, where he spoke in favour of India and Pakistan's accession to full membership. Nunes was awarded the CBE in 1951, whereupon a contemporary noted: \"He is perhaps the greatest name in WI cricket.

It was sometimes urged that, considering his advantages of height, reach and strength, Gunn played too restrained a game, but he had a good answer to his critics. He said once to the writer of these lines, \"I can make as big hits as anyone if I like, but if I begin to lift the ball I never score more than 40.\" As an innings of 40 would in his prime have fallen far short of his desires, he did well to go his own way, and keep the ball down. While batting with complete self-control, he was often brilliant enough to satisfy the most eager lovers of fine hitting, and even when he had a quiet half hour or so he was still a delight to the eye.  His was no sudden jump to fame. Outside Nottingham the public knew nothing of him till he was over 21, and his first efforts in the Notts eleven in 1880 gave little suggestion of the career that was before him. In 20 innings he scored scarcely more than 160 runs. At that time his outfielding was a greater asset than his batting. He could run a hundred yards inside eleven seconds, and he judged the lofty catch unerringly. He learned the game in face of some difficulties. Employed in Richard Daft's shop in Nottingham, he had not much spare time, but, determined to make himself a cricketer, he used to get some practice at unearthly hours in the morning. During the strike of the leading professionals that demoralized Notts cricket in 1881, he stuck to his place in the eleven, and improved so much that he had an average of 24. He was greatly encouraged that season when the old Notts fast bowler, John Jackson, who stood umpire in one of the matches, told him he had never seen a colt, who batted so well. The next two years were years of marked progress--he was second to Shrewsbury in the averages in 1884, when Notts had a wonderful season--and in 1885, with an innings of 203 for the M.C.C. against Yorkshire at Lord's, he took the position among English batsmen that was his untill, in the ordinary course of nature, time began to tell upon him. At his very best from 1889 to 1898, he remained a fine player till 1903, when he scored 998 runs for Notts with an average of 38. Then, with a big and rapidly-growing business to look after, he thought he had done enough. He played in only four matches in 1904, and from that time he was an onlooker, content to see the name of Gunn in Notts cricket worthily kept before the public by his two nephews, George and John.  During his long career William Gunn played many innings that have become historical. His 228 for the Players at Lord's in 1890 is the highest score ever made against the Australians in this country. The Australians as a team were not strong in 1890, but they had Charles Turner and Ferris to bowl for them. With regard to this particular match rather a good story has been told. Asked in an interview whether he had ever felt tired of cricket, Sydney Gregory said he thought not, except, perhaps, when he heard Billy Gunn say \" No \" at Lord's for seven hours and a half. Another great innings that Gunn played was his 139 for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's in W. G. Grace's jubilee match in 1898. Just after he went in Gunn was beaten and all but howled by one of Kortright's fastest. Then he played magnificently, till at last, deceived in the pace, he lunged forward at a slow ball from Woods and was bowled all over his wicket. Between 1888 and 1899, Gunn played in nine matches for England against Australia. He did best in 1893-- when, incidentally, he just beat Stoddart in the season's averages-scoring 77 at Lord's and 102 not out at Manchester. Though he made bigger scores without number, Gunn never played finer cricket than in the memorable match between Notts and Surrey at the Oval in 1892. His 58 against the superb bowling of George Lohmann and Lockwood on a far from easy wicket was a veritable masterpiece of batting. For an hour and a quarter on the second afternoon he and William Barnes withstood a tremendous onslaught. It was cricket that no one who saw it could ever forget. In his young days Gunn was a famous forward at Association Football, combining skill with great speed. He was a mainstay of Notts County and played for England in 1884 against Scotland and Wales.

Primarily he was a bowler, the second in the remarkable succession of slow left-handers -- Edmund Peate, Peel, Wilfred Rhodes and Hedley Verity -- who rendered such brilliant service to Yorkshire over a period of sixty years. Born at Churwell, near Leeds, on February 12, 1857,  Bobby Peel first played for his county in 1882, when  Yorkshire were singularly rich in bowling talent, so that he had to wait several years before attaining real distinction. Still, being a capital fieldsman, especially at cover-point, and a punishing left-handed batsman, he kept his place in the team, and when Peate's connection with the county ceased in unhappy circumstances Peel came to the fore. For nine seasons, with his fine length, easy action and splendid command of spin, this sturdily built left-hander regularly took over 100 wickets for Yorkshire, his county total amounting to 1,550 at an average cost of 15 runs each. He was often a match-winner. In 1887 he took five Kent wickets for 14 runs in an innings and, with 43 runs in a low-scoring match, helped largely in a victory by four wickets. In the same season eleven Leicestershire wickets fell to him for 51 runs at Dewsbury, five in the  first innings for four runs. A year later he took eight  Nottinghamshire wickets in an innings for 12 runs, while in 1892 five wickets for seven runs in an innings and eight for 33 in the match against Derbyshire at Leeds was a startling performance. He did even better in 1895 against  Somerset, 15 wickets falling to him in 36 overs for 5 runs, nine for 22 in one innings causing a sensation. At Halifax in 1897, a month before his county career ended, Peel dismissed eight Kent men in an innings for 53 runs, his match average showing eleven for 85; this performance gave  Yorkshire an innings victory with 103 runs to spare in two days.

Born at Lewisham on March 7, 1851, Mr. Penn had a short but very brilliant career, ranking for several years among the finest batsmen of his day. He had a free, commanding style, and combined strong defence with splendid hitting. Stepping out of ordinary club cricket into first-class matches, he was, from the beginning, thoroughly at home in his new surroundings. He began to play for Kent in 1875, and in the following year he was seen at Lord's for the first time, scoring 44 and 35 for M.C.C. against Yorkshire. No doubt was felt as to his class. Indeed he made such an impression that he was picked for Gentlemen against Players in 1876, both at the Oval and Lord's. Thenceforward he was in the front rank. Unfortunately, his health gave way just when he was at the height of his fame. In the season of 1881 he was attacked by an affection of the heart and, being forbidden to run, had perforce to give up the game. Among those who helped Lord Harris to re-establish Kent cricket no one did better work than Mr. Penn. His best year for the county was 1877 when he made 857 runs in twenty-four innings--three times not out--with an average of 40. He made many big scores for Kent, the highest being 160 against Surrey, at Maidstone in 1878; 148 against Surrey, at the Oval in 1877; and 135 against England, at Canterbury in 1877. Perhaps the innings of his life, however, was 134 at Lord's, for M.C.C. against Cambridge University, in 1879, when he treated A. G. Steel's bowling as it had never been treated before. He had finished with cricket before Test matches became frequent, but it was his privilege to play for England against Australia at the Oval in September, 1880, in the first of the long series of contests in this country. Scoring 23 and not out 27, he made the hit that gave England a victory by five wickets in that memorable game, cutting George Palmer for four. Now that he is dead the only survivors of the England eleven of 1880 are Lord Harris and Mr. A. P. Lucas. Mr. Penn was a member of Lord Harris's team in Australia in 1878-9. He appeared eight times for Gentlemen v. Players, batting well, but without any conspicuous success. His best score was 52, at the Oval in 1876. As a batsman, Mr. Penn had one advantage over many of his contemporaries. Learning the game against bowlers not devoted to the off theory he knew the joy of real leg hitting.

Yorkshire has always been rich in first-rate cricketers, but a finer player than Ulyett the county has never produced. He was for years the best bat in the team, and even if he had not been able to get a run he would have been worth his place for his bowling and fielding. His career for the county extended over a period of twenty years, his first appearance in the eleven dating back to July, 1873. It was seen at once that a player of remarkable gifts had been discovered, and before very long he was at the top of the tree. To begin with, if one remembers rightly, he was played as much for his fast bowling as for his batting. One talent, however, developed to a much greater extent than the other, and in two or three seasons he was quite as good a bat as Ephraim Lockwood, who, when Ulyett came out, was the bright particular star of the Yorkshire eleven. Once having established his position Ulyett never looked back. There was no doubt his class as a batsman after his first visit to Australia with James Lillywhite's team in the winter of  1876-77, and from that time till 1891 he was always in the front rank. Of course, like other great batsmen, he did much better in some seasons than others, but he never lost his place as a representative cricketer. A peculiar interest attaches to the tour of James Lillywhite's team - not, in some respects, very brilliant - as it was then that the Australians first ventured to play an English eleven on even terms. Thanks to a wonderful innings of 165 by  Charles Bannerman, Australia won the first match, but in the return the Englishmen had their revenge, Ulyett's batting deciding the fortunes of the game. It was the fine play they showed that season that led the Australians to pay their first visit to England, a momentous chapter in the history of modern cricket being thus opened.

Born at Burton Joyce on August 29th, 1842, Alfred Shaw played his first match at Lord's in 1864 for the Colts of England against the M. C. C. and Ground.
